'''氧'''（'''Oxygen'''）是一種[[化學元素]]，符號為'''O'''，[[原子序]]為8，在[[元素週期表]]中屬於[[氧族元素|氧族]]。氧屬於[[非金屬]]，是具有高[[化學反應|反應性]]的[[氧化劑]]，能夠與大部分元素以及其他化合物形成[[氧化物]]。<ref>{{cite web |title=WebElements: the periodic table on the web – Oxygen: electronegativities |url=http://www.webelements.com/oxygen/electronegativity.html |publisher=WebElements.com |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>氧在宇宙中的總質量在所有元素中位列第三，僅居[[氫]]和[[氦]]之下。<ref name="NBB297">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.297</ref>在[[標準溫度和壓力]]下，兩個氧原子灰自然[[化學鍵|鍵合]]，形成無色無味的[[氧氣]]，即二氧（{{chem|O|2}}）。氧氣是[[地球大氣層]]的重要成分，在體積上佔20.8%。<ref name="ECE500"/>[[地球地殼]]中近一半的質量都是由氧和氧化物所組成。<ref name="lanl"/>

二氧是細胞[[呼吸作用]]中重要的元素。在[[生物體]]中，主要[[有機分子]]，如[[蛋白質]]、[[核酸]]、[[碳水化合物]]和[[脂肪]]等，還有組成動物外殼、牙齒和骨骼的[[無機化合物]]，都含有氧原子。生物體絕大部分的質量都由含氧原子的水組成。[[光合作用]]利用陽光的能量把水和二氧化碳轉化為氧氣。氧氣的化學反應性強，所以大氣層中的氧氣成分只能通過生物的光合作用持續補充。[[臭氧]]（{{chem|O|3}}）是氧元素的另一種[[同素異構體]]，能夠較好地吸收中[[紫外線]]輻射。位於高海拔的[[臭氧層]]有助阻擋紫外線，從而保護生物圈。不過，在地表上的臭氧屬於污染物，為[[霧霾]]的副產品之一。在[[低地球軌道]]高度的單原子氧足以對航天器造成[[腐蝕]]。<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=August 8, 2009|url=http://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/help/background/atmosphere/erosion.html|title=Atomic oxygen erosion|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613121048/http://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/help/background/atmosphere/erosion.html |archivedate = June 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

[[卡爾·威廉·舍勒]]於1773年或之前在[[烏普薩拉]]最早發現氧元素。[[約瑟夫·普利斯特里]]亦於1774年在[[威爾特郡]]獨立發現氧，因為其成果的發表日期較舍勒早，所以一般被譽為氧的發現者。1777年，[[安東萬-羅倫·德·拉瓦節]]進行了一系列有關氧的實驗，推翻了當時用於解釋[[燃燒]]和[[腐蝕]]的[[燃素說]]。他也提出了氧的現用[[IUPAC]]名稱「oxygen」，<ref name="mellor" />源自[[希臘文]]中的「ὀξύς」（oxys，尖銳，指[[酸]]）和「-γενής」（-genes，產生者）。這是因為命名之時，人們曾以為所有酸都必須含有氧。

氧的應用包括[[暖通空調|暖氣]]、[[內燃機]]、[[鋼鐵]]、[[塑料]]和[[布料]]的生產、金屬[[氣焊和氣割]]、[[火箭推進劑]]、[[氧療]]及[[航空器]]、[[潛艇]]、[[載人航天|載人航天器]]和[[潛水]]所用的[[生命保障系統]]。

==歷史==
===早期實驗===
[[File:Philos experiment of the burning candle.PNG|thumb|upright|[[費隆 (拜占庭)|費隆]]所做的實驗啟發了後世對燃燒與空氣間關係的研究。]]

人類最早研究[[燃燒]]和空氣之間關係，可追溯至前2世紀[[古希臘]]學者[[費隆 (拜占庭)|拜占庭的費隆]]所做的實驗。費隆在著作《氣動學》（{{lang-el|πνευματικά}}）中寫道，如果將點燃的蠟燭置於水中，再用一瓶子蓋住蠟燭至水面，水面就會在瓶頸內上升。<ref>{{cite book|title = Story of Human Error|first = Joseph |last = Jastrow|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tRUO45YfCHwC&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171|page= 171 |date = 1936|publisher = Ayer Publishing|isbn = 0-8369-0568-7}}</ref>費隆錯誤地推論，有一部分空氣經燃燒轉換成[[古典元素|火元素]]，因此可以經玻璃中的小孔逃逸出去。很久以後，[[李安納度·達文西]]在費隆的基礎上又觀察到，燃燒和[[呼吸 (生理學)|呼吸]]都會消耗部分空氣。<ref name="ECE499">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.499.</ref>

17世紀，[[羅拔·波義耳]]證明空氣是燃燒過程必需的物質。{{le|約翰·梅奧|John Mayow}}進一步證明，燃燒只需要空氣中的一種成分，他將之稱為「銅硝石之靈」（{{lang-la|spiritus nitroaereus}}）。<ref name="EB1911">{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|chapter=John Mayow|edition=11th |date=1911|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/John_Mayow|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=''Britannica'' contributors}}</ref>在其中一個實驗中，他發現點燃的蠟燭和老鼠在蓋著水面的密封容器內都會使水面上升，而且在蠟燭熄滅或老鼠死亡時，容器內空氣的四分之一容量會被水取代。<ref name="WoC">{{cite book|title=World of Chemistry|chapter=John Mayow|date=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|url=http://www.bookrags.com/John_Mayow|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=''World of Chemistry'' contributors|isbn=0-669-32727-1}}</ref>他得出的結論是，燃燒和呼吸都會消耗「銅硝石之靈」。

梅奧發現[[銻]]在燃燒之後重量有所提升，由此論證「銅硝石之靈」一定是在燃燒過程中和銻結合了。他也認為，肺臟能將「銅硝石之靈」從空氣中分離出來，運送到血液之中，而動物的熱量和肌肉運動都是「銅硝石之靈」與體內某些其他物質反應的結果。<ref name="EB1911"/>梅奧在1668年《兩篇論文》（{{lang-la|''Tractatus duo''}}）中的〈論呼吸〉（{{lang-la|''De respiratione''}}）一文中發表了這一系列實驗和發現。<ref name="WoC"/>

===燃素說===
{{Main article|燃素說}}
[[File:Georg Ernst Stahl.png|thumb|left|upright|[[格奧爾格·恩斯特·斯塔爾]]推動了燃素說的發展和普及]]

[[羅伯特·虎克]]、{{le|奧勒·博克|Ole Borch}}、[[米哈伊爾·瓦西里耶維奇·羅蒙諾索夫]]和{{le|皮埃爾·巴揚|Pierre Bayen}}在17、18世紀都在實驗中產生了氧氣，但無一發現氧是一種[[化學元素]]。<ref name="NBB299">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.299</ref>由於有當時盛行的燃素說來解釋燃燒和腐蝕過程，因此他們都沒有發現氧氣在這些過程中重要的作用。

燃素說在1667年由煉金術士[[約翰·約阿希姆·貝歇爾]]建立，1731年經化學家[[格奧爾格·恩斯特·斯塔爾]]修改。<ref name="morris">{{cite book| title = The last sorcerers: The path from alchemy to the periodic table
| last = Morris| first = Richard| date = 2003|publisher = Joseph Henry Press|location = Washington, D.C.|isbn = 0-309-08905-0}}</ref>根據燃素說，所有可燃物質都由兩部分組成。一部分為「燃素」，會在物質燃燒過程中釋放出來。不含燃素的部分則是物質的「純態」。<ref name="ECE499"/>木材、煤等可燃性高、燃燒殘留物少的物質都被認為主要是由燃素所組成，鐵等不可燃、會受腐蝕的物質則含有很少的燃素。空氣在燃素說中並無任何作用，此學說最初也未經量化實驗的驗證。燃素說在觀察上的基礎是，大部分常見物質在燃燒過程中都會變輕，所以似乎失去了某種成分。<ref name="ECE499"/>

===發現===
[[File:Carl Wilhelm Scheele from Familj-Journalen1874.png|thumb|upright|舍勒比普利斯特里更早發現氧氣，但研究結果發表得比他遲]]
瑞典藥劑師[[卡爾·威廉·舍勒]]在1771至1772年間最早發現氧。他對[[氧化汞]]和不同[[硝酸鹽]]一同加熱，產生出氧氣。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/8/oxygen |title=Oxygen  |publisher=RSC.org |accessdate=2016-12-12}}</ref><ref name="ECE500"/><ref name="ECE499"/>舍勒把這種氣體產物稱為「火之氣」，因為它能支持燃燒過程。他將這一發現記錄在手稿《論空氣與火的化學》（{{lang-de|''Chemische Abhandlung von der Luft und dem Feuer''}}）中，1775年寄往出版商，1777年出版。<ref name="NBB300">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.300</ref>

[[File:PriestleyFuseli.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[約瑟夫·普利斯特里]]一般被譽為氧的發現者]]

1774年8月1日，英國教士[[約瑟夫·普利斯特里]]把陽光聚焦到裝有[[氧化汞]]的玻璃管中，從而釋放出一種氣體，他將其稱為「無燃素氣」（{{lang-en|dephlogisticated air}}）。<ref name="ECE500">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.500</ref>他注意到，蠟燭在這一氣體中燃燒得更加旺盛，老鼠在呼吸此氣時顯得更加活躍，存活的時間也更長。在自己吸入「無燃素氣」後，普利斯特里寫道：「它在肺中的感覺和普通空氣無異，但一段時間內我感到胸腔格外輕盈舒適，頗感良好。」<ref name="NBB299"/>這些發現於1775年發表在論文《對空氣的進一步發現》（{{le|An Account of Further Discoveries in Air}}）中。<ref name="ECE499"/><ref>{{cite journal|title = An Account of Further Discoveries in Air|first = Joseph|last = Priestley|journal = Philosophical Transactions|date = 1775|volume = 65|pages = 384–94|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1775.0039}}</ref>由於普利斯特里比舍勒更早發表論文，因此常被稱為氧氣的最早發現者。

法國化學家[[安東萬-羅倫·德·拉瓦節]]之後也聲稱獨立發現了氧氣。普利斯特里在1774年10月拜訪拉瓦節時向他說過，這項實驗如何釋放出一種新的氣體，又於1774年9月30日致信拉瓦節，講述他所發現的新物質。拉瓦節並未提及收到過此信。舍勒去世之後，人們在他的遺物之中發現了這封信的副本。<ref name="NBB300"/>
{{clear}}

===拉瓦節的成果===
雖然拉瓦節並沒有獨自發現氧氣，但他卻是對[[氧化過程]]進行量化實驗並正確解釋燃燒過程的第一人。<ref name="ECE500"/>自1774起，他利用一系列實驗推翻了燃素說，又證明普利斯特里和舍勒所生成的物質是一種[[化學元素]]。

[[File:Antoine lavoisier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[安東萬-羅倫·德·拉瓦節]]推翻了燃素說]]

拉瓦節觀察到，在密封容器中對[[錫]]和空氣加熱後，總重量並沒有增加。在打開容器時，空氣會迅速湧入。以此可推論，加熱過程消耗了容器中的部分空氣。他也注意到，錫的重量有所提升，且重量之差和湧入的空氣之重量相同。與此類似的實驗都記錄在拉瓦節的著作《燃燒總論》（{{lang-fr|''Sur la combustion en général''}}）中，1777年出版。他證明空氣是兩種氣體的混合物：燃燒和呼吸過程所必需的「活氣」（{{lang-fr|l'air vital}}），以及無助燃燒和呼吸的「死氣」（{{lang-fr|azote}}，取自希臘文{{lang|grc|ἄζωτον}}，意為「無生命」），也就是[[氮氣]]。法文等某些歐洲語言至今仍稱氮氣為「azote」。<ref name="ECE500"/>

1777年，拉瓦節將「活氣」改名為「oxygène」，結合希臘文詞根「{{lang|grc|ὀξύς}}」（尖銳，指酸味）和「-γενής」（產生者）。之所以詞源提到酸味，是因為他誤以為所有酸都必須含有氧。<ref name="mellor">{{cite book|last=Parks|first=G. D.|last2=Mellor|first2=J. W.|date=1939|title=Mellor's Modern Inorganic Chemistry|edition=6th |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London}}</ref>儘管如此，「oxygen」已成為氧的[[IUPAC]]元素名，在國際上通用。

英國的普利斯特里比拉瓦節更早研究氧氣，「oxygen」一詞也受到了英國科學家的反對。1791年，[[伊拉斯謨斯·達爾文]]（查理斯·達爾文的祖父）的科普詩集《植物園》（{{lang-en|''The Botanic Garden''}}）出版，其中一首名為''Oxygen''的詩以歌頌氧氣為主題，使「oxygen」進入英語詞彙之中。<ref name="NBB300"/>

[[John Dalton]]'s original [[Atomic theory#Earliest empirical evidence|atomic hypothesis]] presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the [[atomic mass]] of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Interactive Textbook of PFP96 |chapter= Do We Take Atoms for Granted?|chapterurl=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/subsubsection1_1_3_2.html |url=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/Contents.html |first=Dennis |last=DeTurck |last2=Gladney|first2=Larry|last3=Pietrovito|first3=Anthony| publisher=University of Pennsylvania|date=1997|accessdate=January 28, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117230939/http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/subsubsection1_1_3_2.html |archivedate = January 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In 1805, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 [[Amedeo Avogadro]] had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called [[Avogadro's law]] and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Chemistry|first=Henry Enfield |last=Roscoe |last2=Schorlemmer|first2=Carl|page=38|date=1883|publisher=D.

By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a [[Cascade (chemical engineering)|cascade]] method, Swiss chemist and physicist [[Raoul Pictet|Raoul Pierre Pictet]] [[evaporation|evaporated]] liquid [[sulfur dioxide]] in order to liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris announcing his discovery of [[liquid oxygen]].<ref name="BES707">{{cite book|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists|last=Daintith|first=John|date=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-7503-0287-9|page=707}}</ref> <!-- NEEDS TO BE CHECKED W/ GOOD CITE The [[Electrical telegraph|telegram]] read "Oxygen liquefied to-day under 320 atmospheres and 140 degrees of cold by combined use of sulfurous and carbonic acid." /NEEDS TO BE CHECKED /W GOOD CITE --> Just two days later, French physicist [[Louis Paul Cailletet]] announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen.<ref name="BES707"/> Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state for the first time on March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from [[Jagiellonian University]], [[Zygmunt Wróblewski]] and [[Karol Olszewski]].<ref>[http://www.poland.gov.pl/Karol,Olszewski,and,Zygmunt,Wroblewski:,condensation,of,oxygen,and,nitrogen,1987.html Poland&nbsp;– Culture, Science and Media.

In 1923, the American scientist [[Robert H. Goddard]] became the first person to develop a [[rocket engine]] that burned liquid fuel; the engine used [[gasoline]] for fuel and liquid oxygen as the [[oxidizer]].

==Characteristics==
===Properties and molecular structure===
[[File:Oxygen molecule orbitals diagram.JPG|thumb|left|260 px|Orbital diagram, after Barrett (2002),<ref name=Barrett2002/> showing the participating atomic orbitals from each oxygen atom, the molecular orbitals that result from their overlap, and the [[Aufbau principle|Aufbau]] filling of the orbitals with the 12 electrons, 6 from each O atom, beginning from the lowest energy orbitals, and resulting in covalent double bond character from filled orbitals (and cancelation of the contributions of the pairs of σ and σ<sup>*</sup> and {{pi}} and {{pi}}<sup>*</sup> orbital pairs).]]
At [[standard temperature and pressure]], oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas with the [[molecular formula]] {{chem|O|2}}, referred to as dioxygen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/chemistry/oxygen.html|title=Oxygen Facts|publisher=Science Kids|date=February 6, 2015|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref>

As ''dioxygen'', two oxygen atoms are [[chemical bond|chemically bound]] to each other. The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent [[double bond]] that results from the filling of [[molecular orbitals]] formed from the [[atomic orbital]]s of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a [[bond order]] of two. More specifically, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or [[Aufbau principle|Aufbau]], filling of orbitals, and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after sequential filling of the low σ and σ<sup>*</sup> orbitals; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and {{pi}} overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest {{pi}} and {{pi}}<sup>*</sup> orbitals.<ref name=Barrett2002>Jack Barrett, 2002, "Atomic Structure and Periodicity, (Basic concepts in chemistry, Vol. 9 of Tutorial chemistry texts), Cambridge, U.K.:Royal Society of Chemistry, p. 153, ISBN 0854046577, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0854046577] accessed January 31, 2015.</ref>

This combination of cancellations and σ and {{pi}} overlaps results in dioxygen's double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic [[ground state]]. An [[electron configuration]] with two unpaired electrons, as is found in dioxygen orbitals (see the filled {{pi}}* orbitals in the diagram) that are of equal energy—i.e., [[degenerate orbitals|degenerate]]—is a configuration termed a [[spin triplet]] state. Hence, the ground state of the {{chem|O|2}} molecule is referred to as [[triplet oxygen]].<ref name="BiochemOnline">{{cite web|work=Biochemistry Online|url=http://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/ch331/oxphos/oldioxygenchem.html |title=Chapter 8: Oxidation-Phosphorylation, the Chemistry of Di-Oxygen|first=Henry|last=Jakubowski|accessdate=January 28, 2008|publisher=Saint John's University}}</ref><ref group=lower-alpha>An orbital is a concept from [[quantum mechanics]] that models an electron as a [[Wave–particle duality|wave-like particle]] that has a spatial distribution about an atom or molecule.</ref> The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are [[antibonding]], and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.<ref name="Weiss2008">{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = H.

The {{chem|O|2}} surrounding those planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.

The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the [[oxygen cycle]]. This [[biogeochemical cycle]] describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the [[biosphere]], and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], [[Decomposition|decay]], and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year.

Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of {{chem|O|2}} at lower temperatures (see [[#Physical properties|Physical properties]]) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content.<ref>From The Chemistry and Fertility of Sea Waters by H.W.

Harvey notes that according to later articles in ''Nature'', the values appear to be about 3% too high.</ref> [[Water pollution|Water polluted]] with plant nutrients such as [[nitrate]]s or [[phosphate]]s may stimulate growth of algae by a process called [[eutrophication]] and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the {{chem|O|2}} content in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's [[biochemical oxygen demand]], or the amount of {{chem|O|2}} needed to restore it to a normal concentration.<ref name="NBB301">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.301</ref>

[[Paleoclimatology|Paleoclimatologists]] measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the [[Animal shell|shells]] and [[skeleton]]s of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago (see [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]). [[Seawater]] molecules that contain the lighter [[isotope]], oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures.<ref name="NBB304">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.304</ref> During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate.<ref name="NBB304"/> Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of [[ice core]] samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.

[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Planetary geologists]] have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and [[meteorite]]s, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the [[Sun]], believed to be the same as those of the [[Nebular hypothesis|primordial solar nebula]]. Analysis of a [[silicon]] wafer exposed to the [[solar wind]] in space and returned by the crashed [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis spacecraft]] has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's [[Protoplanetary disk|disk of protoplanetary material]] prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Hand|first = Eric|title = The Solar System's first breath|journal = Nature|volume = 452|page = 259|date = March 13, 2008|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080313/full/452259a.html|doi = 10.1038/452259a|accessdate =March 18, 2009|pmid = 18354437|issue = 7185|bibcode = 2008Natur.452..259H }}</ref>

In nature, free oxygen is produced by the [[photolysis|light-driven splitting]] of water during oxygenic [[photosynthesis]]. According to some estimates, [[green algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g6RfkqCUQyQC&pg=PA147|title=Plants: the potentials for extracting protein, medicines, and other useful chemicals (workshop proceedings)|date=September 1983|chapter=Marine Plants: A Unique and Unexplored Resource|last=Fenical|first=William|page=147|isbn=1-4289-2397-7|publisher=DIANE Publishing}}</ref> Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=J.

Oxygen is used in [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] to generate ATP during [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as:

==Industrial production==

{{see also|Air separation|Oxygen evolution|fractional distillation}}

One hundred&nbsp;million&nbsp;tonnes of {{chem|O|2}} are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods.<ref name="NBB300"/> The most common method is [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air, with {{chem|N|2}} [[distillation|distilling]] as a vapor while {{chem|O|2}} is left as a liquid.<ref name="NBB300"/>

The other primary method of producing {{chem|O|2}} is passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical [[zeolite]] molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90%&nbsp;to&nbsp;93% {{chem|O|2}}.<ref name="NBB300"/> Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as [[pressure swing adsorption]]. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-[[cryogenics|cryogenic]] technologies (see also the related [[vacuum swing adsorption]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uigi.com/noncryo.html|title=Non-Cryogenic Air Separation Processes|date=2003|accessdate=December 16, 2007|publisher=UIG Inc.}}</ref>

Oxygen gas can also be produced through [[electrolysis of water]] into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. Contrary to popular belief, the 2:1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H<sub>2</sub>O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves. A similar method is the electrocatalytic {{chem|O|2}} evolution from oxides and [[oxoacid]]s. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in [[chemical oxygen generator]]s or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through [[ceramic]] membranes based on [[zirconium dioxide]] by either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure {{chem|O|2}} gas.<ref name="NBB301"/>

In large quantities, the price of liquid oxygen in 2001 was approximately $0.21/kg.<ref>{{Cite book|quote=NASAFacts FS-2001-09-015-KSC|title=Space Shuttle Use of Propellants and Fluids|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|date=September 2001|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/ps/SSP.ps|accessdate=December 16, 2007}}</ref> Since the primary cost of production is the energy cost of liquefying the air, the production cost will change as energy cost varies.

== Storage ==
[[Oxygen storage]] methods include high pressure [[oxygen tank]]s, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one [[litre|liter]] of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840&nbsp;liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and {{convert|20|C|F}}.<ref name="NBB300"/> Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through [[heat exchanger]]s, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting]].<ref name="NBB300"/>

{{Main article|Oxygen therapy}}

Uptake of {{chem|O|2}} from the air is the essential purpose of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], so oxygen supplementation is used in [[medicine]]. Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart.

Oxygen, as a supposed mild [[euphoria|euphoric]], has a history of recreational use in [[oxygen bar]]s and in [[sport]]s. Oxygen bars are establishments found in Japan, [[California]], and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal {{chem|O|2}} exposure for a fee.<ref name="FDA-O2Bars">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/2002/602_air.html| title=Oxygen Bars: Is a Breath of Fresh Air Worth It?|last=Bren|first=Linda|work=FDA Consumer magazine|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=November–December 2002|accessdate=December 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018041754/http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/2002/602_air.html|archivedate=October 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Professional athletes, especially in [[American football]], sometimes go off-field between plays to don oxygen masks to boost performance.

===Industrial===
[[File:Clabecq JPG01.jpg|thumb|Most commercially produced {{chem|O|2}} is used to [[smelting|smelt]] [[iron]] into [[steel]].|alt=An elderly worker in a helmet is facing his side to the viewer in an industrial hall.

[[Smelting]] of [[iron ore]] into [[steel]] consumes 55% of commercially produced oxygen.<ref name="NBB301"/> In this process, {{chem|O|2}} is injected through a high-pressure lance into molten iron, which removes [[sulfur]] impurities and excess [[carbon]] as the respective oxides, {{chem|SO|2}} and {{chem|CO|2}}. The reactions are [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], so the temperature increases to 1,700&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].<ref name="NBB301"/>

Another 25% of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical industry.<ref name="NBB301"/> [[Ethylene]] is reacted with {{chem|O|2}} to create [[ethylene oxide]], which, in turn, is converted into [[ethylene glycol]]; the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of products, including [[antifreeze]] and [[polyester]] polymers (the precursors of many [[plastic]]s and [[fabric]]s).<ref name="NBB301"/>

Most of the remaining 20% of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications, [[gas welding|metal cutting and welding]], as an oxidizer in [[rocket fuel]], and in [[water treatment]].<ref name="NBB301"/> Oxygen is used in [[oxyacetylene welding]] burning [[acetylene]] with {{chem|O|2}} to produce a very hot flame. In this process, metal up to {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} thick is first heated with a small oxy-acetylene flame and then quickly cut by a large stream of {{chem|O|2}}.<ref name="ECE508">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.508</ref>

<!-- DIRECT ALL FUTURE EXPANSION to [[Compounds of oxygen]] -->
[[File:Stilles Mineralwasser.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Water]] ({{chem|H|2|O}}) is the most familiar oxygen compound.|alt=Water flowing from a bottle into a glass.]]
The [[oxidation state]] of oxygen is −2 in almost all known compounds of oxygen. The oxidation state −1 is found in a few compounds such as [[peroxide]]s.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw}},p. 28</ref> Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: −1/2 ([[superoxide]]s), −1/3 ([[ozonide]]s), 0 ([[Allotropes of oxygen|elemental]], [[hypofluorous acid]]), +1/2 ([[dioxygenyl]]), +1 ([[dioxygen difluoride]]), and +2 ([[oxygen difluoride]]).

===Oxides and other inorganic compounds===
<!-- DIRECT ALL FUTURE EXPANSION to [[Compounds of oxygen]]  -->
[[Water]] ({{chem|H|2|O}}) is an oxide of [[hydrogen]] and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are [[covalent bonding|covalently bonded]] to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3&nbsp;kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup> per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule.<ref>{{cite journal|first=P.|last=Maksyutenko|first2=T.

[[File:Rust screw.jpg|thumb|left|Oxides, such as [[iron oxide]] or [[rust]], form when oxygen combines with other elements.|alt=A rusty piece of a bolt.]]
Due to its [[electronegativity]], oxygen forms [[chemical bond]]s with almost all other elements to give corresponding [[oxide]]s. The surface of most metals, such as [[aluminium]] and [[titanium]], are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivates]] the metal and slows further [[corrosion]]. Many oxides of the [[transition metal]]s are [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s, with slightly less metal than the [[chemical formula]] would show. For example, the mineral [[Iron(II) oxide|FeO]] ([[wüstite]]) is written as {{chem|Fe|1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''x''|O}}, where ''x'' is usually around 0.05.<ref>{{cite book|first=Lesley E.|last=Smart|last2=Moore|first2=Elaine A. |title=Solid State Chemistry: An Introduction|edition=3rd |publisher=CRC Press|date=2005|page=214|isbn=978-0-7487-7516-3}}</ref>

Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2}}). The [[Earth's crust]]al [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is composed in large part of oxides of [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|silica]] {{chem|SiO|2}}, as found in [[granite]] and [[quartz]]), aluminium ([[aluminium oxide]] {{chem|Al|2|O|3}}, in [[bauxite]] and [[corundum]]), iron ([[iron(III) oxide]] {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}, in [[hematite]] and [[rust]]), and [[calcium carbonate]] (in [[limestone]]). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex [[silicate]]s (in [[silicate minerals]]). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.

Water-[[solubility|soluble]] silicates in the form of {{chem|Na|4|SiO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|SiO|3}}, and {{chem|Na|2|Si|2|O|5}} are used as [[detergent]]s and [[adhesive]]s.<ref name="ECE507">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.507</ref>

Oxygen also acts as a [[ligand]] for transition metals, forming [[transition metal dioxygen complexes]], which feature metal–{{chem|O|2}}.  This class of compounds includes the [[heme]] proteins [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Crabtree|first=R.|title=The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals|edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|date=2001|page=152|isbn=978-0-471-18423-2}}</ref> An exotic and unusual reaction occurs with [[platinum hexafluoride|{{chem|PtF|6}}]], which oxidizes oxygen to give O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>PtF<sub>6</sub><sup>−</sup>.<ref name="ECE505">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.505</ref>

===Organic compounds and biomolecules===

|alt=A ball structure of a molecule. Its backbone is a zig-zag chain of three carbon atoms connected in the center to an oxygen atom and on the end to 6 hydrogens.]]
[[File:ATP structure.svg|thumb|left|Oxygen represents more than 40% of the [[molecular mass]] of the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecule.|alt=Skeletal chemical structure with a linear chain of O-P-O bonds connected to three different carbon-nitrogen rings.]]

Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where "R" is an organic group): [[alcohol]]s (R-OH); [[ether]]s (R-O-R); [[ketone]]s (R-CO-R); [[aldehyde]]s (R-CO-H); [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-COOH); [[ester]]s (R-COO-R); [[acid anhydride]]s (R-CO-O-CO-R); and [[amide]]s ({{chem|R-C(O)-NR|2}}). There are many important organic [[solvent]]s that contain oxygen, including: [[acetone]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]], [[furan]], [[tetrahydrofuran|THF]], [[diethyl ether]], [[1,4-Dioxane|dioxane]], [[ethyl acetate]], [[dimethylformamide|DMF]], [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[acetic acid]], and [[formic acid]]. Acetone ({{chem|(CH|3|)|2|CO}}) and [[phenol]] ({{chem|C|6|H|5|OH}}) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: [[glycerol]], [[formaldehyde]], [[glutaraldehyde]], [[citric acid]], [[acetic anhydride]], and [[acetamide]]. [[Epoxide]]s are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.

Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds at or below room temperature in a process called [[autoxidation]].<ref name="ECE506">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.506</ref> Most of the [[organic compound]]s that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of {{chem|O|2}}. Organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include [[ethylene oxide]] and [[peracetic acid]].<ref name="ECE507"/>

The element is found in almost all [[biomolecule]]s that are important to (or generated by) life. Only a few common complex biomolecules, such as [[squalene]] and the [[carotene]]s, contain no oxygen. Of the organic compounds with biological relevance, [[carbohydrate]]s contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen. All [[fat]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[protein]]s contain oxygen (due to the presence of [[carbonyl]] groups in these acids and their ester residues). Oxygen also occurs in [[phosphate]] ({{chem|PO|4|3-}}) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], in the backbone and the [[purine]]s (except [[adenine]]) and [[pyrimidine]]s of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]], and in bones as [[calcium phosphate]] and [[hydroxylapatite]].

==Safety and precautions==
The [[NFPA 704]] standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) is given a health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of [[hyperoxia]] from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form.

===Toxicity===

[[File:Scuba-diving.jpg|thumb|Oxygen toxicity occurs when the lungs take in {{frac|2|1|2}} higher than normal {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure, which can occur in deep [[scuba diving]].|alt=Four divers, equipped with oxygen cylinders, at the see bottom.]]

Oxygen gas ({{chem|O|2}}) can be [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]] at elevated [[partial pressure]]s, leading to [[convulsion]]s and other health problems.<ref name="Acott" /><ref group=lower-alpha>Since {{chem|O|2}}'s partial pressure is the fraction of {{chem|O|2}} times the total pressure, elevated partial pressures can occur either from high {{chem|O|2}} fraction in breathing gas or from high breathing gas pressure, or a combination of both.</ref><ref name="ECE511">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.511</ref> Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilo[[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]&nbsp;(kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure of about 21&nbsp;kPa. This is not a problem except for patients on [[mechanical ventilator]]s, since gas supplied through [[oxygen mask]]s in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%–50% {{chem|O|2}} by volume (about 30&nbsp;kPa at standard pressure).<ref name="NBB299"/> (although this figure also is subject to wide variation, depending on type of mask).

At one time, [[Premature birth|premature babies]] were placed in incubators containing {{chem|O|2}}-rich air, but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high.<ref name="NBB299"/>

Breathing pure {{chem|O|2}} in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early spacecraft such as [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo]], causes no damage due to the low total pressures used.<ref name="pmid11541018"/><ref>{{cite web|last = Wade|first = Mark|date = 2007|url = http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/spasuits.htm|title = Space Suits|publisher = Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=December 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213122134/http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/spasuits.htm |archivedate = December 13, 2007}}</ref> In the case of spacesuits, the {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30&nbsp;kPa (1.4 times normal), and the resulting {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure (for more information on this, see [[space suit]] and [[arterial blood gas]]).

Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and [[central nervous system]] can also occur in deep [[scuba diving]] and [[surface supplied diving]].<ref name="NBB299"/><ref name="Acott"/> Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an {{chem|O|2}} partial pressure more than 60&nbsp;kPa can eventually lead to permanent [[pulmonary fibrosis]].<ref name="BMJ">{{cite journal |author=Wilmshurst P |title=Diving and oxygen |journal=BMJ |volume=317 |issue=7164 |pages=996–9 |date=1998 |pmid=9765173 |pmc=1114047 |doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7164.996}}</ref> Exposure to a {{chem|O|2}} partial pressures greater than 160&nbsp;kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers).

Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. [[Fire]] and [[explosion]] hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and [[fuel]]s are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion.<ref name="Weiss2008" /><ref name="astm-tpt">{{cite conference|editor1-last=Werley|editor1-first=Barry L.|date=1991|work=Fire Hazards in Oxygen Systems|title=ASTM Technical Professional training|publisher=[[ASTM International]] Subcommittee G-4.05|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion.<ref name="Weiss2008" /><ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2015" /> Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential, such as [[peroxide]]s, [[chlorate]]s, [[nitrate]]s, [[perchlorate]]s, and [[dichromate]]s because they can donate oxygen to a fire.

Concentrated {{chem|O|2}} will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically.<ref name="astm-tpt" /> [[Steel]] pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and [[liquid oxygen]] will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of {{chem|O|2}} systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized.<ref name="astm-tpt" /> The fire that killed the [[Apollo 1]] crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure {{chem|O|2}} but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the {{frac|1|3}} normal pressure that would be used in a mission.{{refn|No single ignition source of the fire was conclusively identified, although some evidence points to arc from an electrical spark.<ref>(Report of Apollo 204 Review Board NASA Historical Reference Collection, NASA History Office, NASA HQ, Washington, DC)</ref>|group=lower-alpha}}<ref name="chiles">{{cite book|last=Chiles|first=James R.|date=2001|title=Inviting Disaster: Lessons from the edge of Technology: An inside look at catastrophes and why they happen|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc.|isbn=0-06-662082-1}}</ref>

Liquid oxygen spills, if allowed to soak into organic matter, such as [[wood]], [[petrochemical]]s, and [[asphalt]] can cause these materials to [[Detonation|detonate]] unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact.<ref name="astm-tpt" /> As with other [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] liquids, on contact with the human body it can cause [[frostbite]]s to the skin and the eyes.
