'''氯'''，[[化學元素]]，符號為'''Cl'''，[[原子序]]為17。氯是質量第二低的[[鹵素]]，在[[元素週期表]]上位於[[氟]]和[[溴]]之間，其不少性質也介乎兩者之間。在室溫下，氯是一種氣體，呈淡黃綠色。氯的反應性極高，是一種強[[氧化劑]]：在所有化學元素中，它的[[電子親和能]]最高，鮑林[[電負性]]排列第三（僅位於[[氧]]和[[氟]]以下）。

[[氯化鈉]]，亦即食鹽，是地球上最常見的氯[[化合物]]，自古便為人所知。1630年前後，氯氣首次在化學反應中產生，但當時並未受人重視。[[卡爾·威廉·舍勒]]在1774年記錄下他對氯氣的觀測，並提出它可能是某種新元素的[[氧化物]]。化學家在1809年提出氯氣可能是一種純元素，直到1810年經[[漢弗里·戴維]]的實驗得以證實。戴維根據「{{lang-grc|χλωρός|khlôros|淡綠色}}」將其名為「chlorine」。

由於氯的反應性極高，因此[[地殼]]中的氯元素都是以[[氯化物]]的形態存在，食鹽便是其中一種。氯[[地殼元素豐度列表|在地殼中的豐度]]在鹵素之中排第二（氟位列第一），在所有元素之中排第21。然而，地球上絕大部分的氯都在海水裡。

氯氣的商業生產方式是對濃海水進行[[電解]]提取。氯的氧化性很高，所以被廣泛用於生產[[漂白劑]]和[[消毒劑]]，在化工產業中也有諸多用途。許多消費品都含有氯，其中約三分之二是有機化學物，如[[聚氯乙烯]]；包括[[塑料]]在內的不少材料儘管本身不含氯，但在生產過程中也都需要用到氯和氯化合物。氯氣以及會生成氯氣的化合物可以直接用於對[[游泳池]]水進行消毒。高濃度氯氣對於所有生物都屬於[[毒物]]，有極高的危險性。[[第一次世界大戰]]期間，氯氣曾被用作[[化學武器]]，是最早被人類使用的氣體化學武器。

所有已知生物都需要氯[[離子]]才能生存，但生物體一般不含其他類型的氯化合物。在人工製成的含氯有機物中，有的對生物體呈惰性，有的則具毒性。[[地球大氣層|大氣上層]]所含的含氯有機分子包括[[氯氟烴]]，是造成[[臭氧層空洞]]的主因之一。[[免疫系統]]在對付細菌時，[[中性粒細胞]]會對氯離子進行氧化，產生[[次氯酸鹽]]，從而生成少量氯氣。

The resulting liquid, known as "''Eau de Javel''" ("[[Javel water]]"), was a weak solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]]. This process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. Scottish chemist and industrialist [[Charles Tennant]] first produced a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] ("chlorinated lime"), then solid calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder).<ref name=encyc/> These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near the end of the nineteenth century, E. S.

Elemental chlorine solutions dissolved in [[base (chemistry)|chemically basic]] water (sodium and [[calcium hypochlorite]]) were first used as anti-[[putrefaction]] agents and [[disinfectant]]s in the 1820s, in France, long before the establishment of the [[germ theory of disease]].

==Properties==
[[File:Chlorine liquid in an ampoule.jpg|thumb|Chlorine, liquefied under a pressure of 7.4 bar at room temperature, displayed in a quartz ampule embedded in [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic glass]].]]
[[File:Die chemischen elemente cl.jpg|thumb|Solid chlorine at −150&nbsp;°C]]
Chlorine is the second [[halogen]], being a [[nonmetal]] in group 17 of the periodic table. Its properties are thus similar to [[fluorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]], and are largely intermediate between those of the first two. Chlorine has the electron configuration [Ne]3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>5</sup>, with the seven electrons in the third and outermost shell acting as its [[valence electron]]s. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell.<ref name=Greenwood800>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800–4</ref> Corresponding to [[periodic trend]]s, it is intermediate in [[electronegativity]] between fluorine and bromine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than fluorine and more reactive than bromine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine, but a stronger one than bromine. Conversely, the [[chloride]] ion is a weaker reducing agent than bromide, but a stronger one than fluoride.<ref name=Greenwood800/> It is intermediate in [[atomic radius]] between fluorine and bromine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties similarly continuing the trend from iodine to bromine upward, such as first [[ionisation energy]], [[electron affinity]], enthalpy of dissociation of the X<sub>2</sub> molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. (Fluorine is anomalous due to its small size.)<ref name=Greenwood800/>

All four stable halogens experience intermolecular [[van der Waals force]]s of attraction, and their strength increases together with the number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of chlorine are intermediate between those of fluorine and bromine: chlorine melts at −101.0&nbsp;°C and boils at −34.0&nbsp;°C. As a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of chlorine are again intermediate between those of bromine and fluorine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure.<ref name=Greenwood800/> The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: thus, while fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is distinctly yellow-green. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group.<ref name=Greenwood800/> Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as chlorine, results from the [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] antibonding ''π<sub>g</sub>'' molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding ''σ<sub>u</sub>'' molecular orbital.<ref name=Greenwood804>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804–09</ref> The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid chlorine at −195&nbsp;°C is almost colourless.<ref name=Greenwood800/>

Like solid bromine and iodine, solid chlorine crystallises in the [[orthorhombic crystal system]], in a layered lattice of Cl<sub>2</sub> molecules. The Cl–Cl distance is 198&nbsp;pm (close to the gaseous Cl–Cl distance of 199&nbsp;pm) and the Cl···Cl distance between molecules is 332&nbsp;pm within a layer and 382&nbsp;pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of chlorine, 180&nbsp;pm). This structure means that chlorine is a very poor conductor of electricity, and indeed its conductivity is so low as to be practically unmeasurable.<ref name=Greenwood800/>

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of chlorine}}
Chlorine has two stable isotopes, <sup>35</sup>Cl and <sup>37</sup>Cl. These are its only two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with <sup>35</sup>Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and <sup>37</sup>Cl making up the remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the [[oxygen-burning process|oxygen-burning]] and [[silicon-burning process]]es.<ref name="Cameron">{{cite journal|last1=Cameron |first1=A. G.

The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with [[half-life|half-lives]] too short to occur in nature [[primordial element|primordially]]. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are <sup>36</sup>Cl (''t''<sub>1/2</sub> = 3.0×10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;y) and <sup>38</sup>Cl (''t''<sub>1/2</sub> = 37.2&nbsp;min), which may be produced from the [[neutron activation]] of natural chlorine.<ref name=Greenwood800/>

The most stable chlorine radioisotope is <sup>36</sup>Cl. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than <sup>35</sup>Cl is [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[sulfur]]; that of isotopes heavier than <sup>37</sup>Cl is [[beta decay]] to isotopes of [[argon]]; and <sup>36</sup>Cl may decay by either mode to stable <sup>36</sup>S or <sup>36</sup>Ar.<ref name=NUBASE>{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref> [[Chlorine-36|<sup>36</sup>Cl]] occurs in trace quantities in nature as a [[cosmogenic nuclide]] in a ratio of about (7–10)&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>−13</sup> to 1 with stable chlorine isotopes: it is produced in the atmosphere by [[spallation]] of <sup>36</sup>[[argon|Ar]] by interactions with [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s. In the top meter of the lithosphere, <sup>36</sup>Cl is generated primarily by [[thermal neutron]] activation of <sup>35</sup>Cl and spallation of <sup>39</sup>[[Potassium|K]] and <sup>40</sup>[[Calcium|Ca]]. In the subsurface environment, [[muon capture]] by <sup>40</sup>[[Calcium|Ca]] becomes more important as a way to generate <sup>36</sup>Cl.<ref name=Zreda>{{cite journal | author = M.

Chlorine is intermediate in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, and is one of the most reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the [[standard electrode potential]]s of the X<sub>2</sub>/X<sup>−</sup> couples (F, +2.866&thinsp;V; Cl, +1.395&thinsp;V; Br, +1.087&thinsp;V; I, +0.615&thinsp;V; At, approximately +0.3&thinsp;V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states than fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.<ref name=Greenwood804/>

Given that E°({{sfrac|1|2}}O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O) = +1.229&thinsp;V, which is less than +1.395&thinsp;V, it would be expected that chlorine should be able to oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble [[overpotential]] effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.<ref name=Greenwood853>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 853–56</ref>

===Hydrogen chloride===
[[File:DCl Neutron powder.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Structure of solid deuterium chloride, with D···Cl hydrogen bonds]]
The simplest chlorine compound is [[hydrogen chloride]], HCl, a major chemical in industry as well as in the laboratory, both as a gas and dissolved in water as [[hydrochloric acid]]. It is often produced by burning hydrogen gas in chlorine gas, or as a byproduct of chlorinating [[hydrocarbon]]s. Another approach is to treat [[sodium chloride]] with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] to produce hydrochloric acid, also known as the "salt-cake" process:<ref name=Greenwood809/>
:NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> {{overunderset|⟶|150&thinsp;°C|&thinsp;}} NaHSO<sub>4</sub> + HCl
:NaCl + NaHSO<sub>4</sub> {{overunderset|⟶|540–600&thinsp;°C|&thinsp;}} Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + HCl
In the laboratory, hydrogen chloride gas may be made by drying the acid with concentrated sulfuric acid. [[Deuterium chloride]], DCl, may be produced by reacting [[benzoyl chloride]] with [[heavy water]] (D<sub>2</sub>O).<ref name=Greenwood809>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809–12</ref>

At room temperature, hydrogen chloride is a colourless gas, like all the hydrogen halides apart from [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen chloride at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised.<ref name=Greenwood809/> Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (p''K''<sub>a</sub> = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H<sub>2</sub>O system has many hydrates HCl·''n''H<sub>2</sub>O for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H<sub>2</sub>O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 108.58&thinsp;°C at 20.22&thinsp;g HCl per 100&thinsp;g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.<ref name=Greenwood812>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812–16</ref>

Unlike hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous liquid hydrogen chloride is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup> and {{chem|HCl|2|-}} ions – the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and chlorine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs<sup>+</sup>]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu<sup>''n''</sup>]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride is a poor solvent, only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as [[nitrosyl chloride]] and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides. It readily protonates [[electrophile]]s containing lone-pairs or π bonds. [[Solvolysis]], [[ligand]] replacement reactions, and oxidations are well-characterised in hydrogen chloride solution:<ref name=Greenwood818>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 818–19</ref>
:Ph<sub>3</sub>SnCl + HCl ⟶ Ph<sub>2</sub>SnCl<sub>2</sub> + PhH (solvolysis)
:Ph<sub>3</sub>COH + 3 HCl ⟶ {{chem|Ph|3|C|+|HCl|2|-}} + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> (solvolysis)
:{{chem|Me|4|N|+|HCl|2|-}} + BCl<sub>3</sub> ⟶ {{chem|Me|4|N|+|BCl|4|-}} + HCl (ligand replacement)
:PCl<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> + HCl ⟶ {{chem|PCl|4|+|HCl|2|-}} (oxidation)

===Other binary chlorides===
[[File:Nickel(II)-chloride-hexahydrate-sample.jpg|thumb|right|Hydrated [[nickel(II) chloride]], NiCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>.]]
Nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary chlorides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es, with the exception of [[xenon]] in the highly unstable [[xenon dichloride|XeCl<sub>2</sub>]] and XeCl<sub>4</sub>); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than chlorine's ([[oxygen]] and [[fluorine]]) so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not chlorides but rather oxides or fluorides of chlorine.<ref name=Greenwood821>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821–44</ref>

Chlorination of metals with Cl<sub>2</sub> usually leads to a higher oxidation state than bromination with Br<sub>2</sub> when multiple oxidation states are available, such as in [[molybdenum(V) chloride|MoCl<sub>5</sub>]] and [[molybdenum(III) bromide|MoBr<sub>3</sub>]]. Chlorides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydrochloric acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas. These methods work best when the chloride product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative chlorination of the element with chlorine or hydrogen chloride, high-temperature chlorination of a metal oxide or other halide by chlorine, a volatile metal chloride, [[carbon tetrachloride]], or an organic chloride. For instance, [[zirconium dioxide]] reacts with chlorine at standard conditions to produce [[zirconium tetrachloride]], and [[uranium trioxide]] reacts with [[hexachloropropene]] when heated under [[reflux]] to give [[uranium tetrachloride]]. The second example also involves a reduction in [[oxidation state]], which can also be achieved by reducing a higher chloride using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent. This may also be achieved by thermal decomposition or disproportionation as follows:<ref name=Greenwood821/>
: EuCl<sub>3</sub> + {{sfrac|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub> ⟶ EuCl<sub>2</sub> + HCl
: ReCl<sub>5</sub> {{overunderset|⟶|at "bp"|&thinsp;}} ReCl<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>
: AuCl<sub>3</sub> {{overunderset|⟶|160&thinsp;°C|&thinsp;}} AuCl + Cl<sub>2</sub>

Most of the chlorides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular chlorides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. [[Silver chloride]] is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for chlorine.<ref name=Greenwood821/>

===Polychlorine compounds===
Although dichlorine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy, it may be oxidised under extreme conditions to form the {{chem|Cl|2|+}} cation. This is very unstable and has only been characterised by its electronic band spectrum when produced in a low-pressure discharge tube. The yellow {{chem|Cl|3|+}} cation is more stable and may be produced as follows:<ref name=Greenwood842>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 842–44</ref>
:Cl<sub>2</sub> + ClF + AsF<sub>5</sub> {{overunderset|⟶|−78&thinsp;°C|&thinsp;}} {{chem|Cl|3|+|AsF|6|-}}
This reaction is conducted in the oxidising solvent [[arsenic pentafluoride]]. The trichloride anion, {{chem|Cl|3|-}}, has also been characterised; it is analogous to [[triiodide]].<ref name=Greenwood824/>

===Chlorine fluorides===
The three fluorides of chlorine form a subset of the [[interhalogen]] compounds, all of which are [[diamagnetic]].<ref name=Greenwood824>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824–8</ref> Some cationic and anionic derivatives are known, such as {{chem|ClF|2|-}}, {{chem|ClF|4|-}}, {{chem|ClF|2|+}}, and Cl<sub>2</sub>F<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=Greenwood835>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 835–42</ref> Some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] of chlorine are also known, such as [[cyanogen chloride]] (ClCN, linear), chlorine [[cyanate]] (ClNCO), chlorine [[thiocyanate]] (ClSCN, unlike its oxygen counterpart), and chlorine [[azide]] (ClN<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=Greenwood824/>

[[Chlorine monofluoride]] (ClF) is extremely thermally stable, and is sold commercially in 500-gram steel lecture bottles. It is a colourless gas that melts at −155.6&thinsp;°C and boils at −100.1&thinsp;°C. It may be produced by the direction of its elements at 225&thinsp;°C, though it must then be separated and purified from [[chlorine trifluoride]] and its reactants. Its properties are mostly intermediate between those of chlorine and fluorine. It will react with many metals and nonmetals from room temperature and above, fluorinating them and liberating chlorine. It will also act as a chlorofluorinating agent, adding chlorine and fluorine across a multiple bond or by oxidation: for example, it will attack [[carbon monoxide]] to form [[carbonyl chlorofluoride]], COFCl. It will react analogously with [[hexafluoroacetone]], (CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO, with a [[potassium fluoride]] catalyst to produce [[heptafluoroisopropyl hypochlorite]], (CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CFOCl; with [[nitrile]]s RCN to produce RCF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>; and with the sulfur oxides SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub> to produce ClOSO<sub>2</sub>F and ClSO<sub>2</sub>F respectively. It will also react exothermically and violently with compounds containing –OH and –NH groups, such as water:<ref name=Greenwood824/>
:H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 ClF ⟶ 2 HF + Cl<sub>2</sub>O

[[Chlorine trifluoride]] (ClF<sub>3</sub>) is a volatile colourless molecular liquid which melts at −76.3&thinsp;°C and boils at 11.8&thinsp;°C. It may be formed by directly fluorinating gaseous chlorine or chlorine monofluoride at 200–300&thinsp;°C. It is one of the most reactive known chemical compounds, reacting with many substances which in ordinary circumstances would be considered chemically inert, such as [[asbestos]], concrete, and sand. It explodes on contact with water and most organic substances. The list of elements it sets on fire is diverse, containing [[hydrogen]], [[potassium]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and powdered [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]], [[rhodium]], [[iridium]], and [[iron]]. An impermeable fluoride layer is formed by [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], and [[silver]], which may be removed by heating. When heated, even such [[noble metal]]s as [[palladium]], [[platinum]], and [[gold]] are attacked and even the [[noble gas]]es [[xenon]] and [[radon]] do not escape fluorination. [[Nickel]] containers are usually used due to that metal's great resistance to attack by chlorine trifluoride, stemming from the formation of an unreactive nickel fluoride layer. Its reaction with [[hydrazine]] to form hydrogen fluoride, nitrogen, and chlorine gases was used in experimental rocket motors, but has problems largely stemming from its extreme [[Hypergolic propellant|hypergolicity]] resulting in ignition without any measurable delay. Today, it is mostly used in nuclear fuel processing, to oxidise [[uranium]] to [[uranium hexafluoride]] for its enriching and to separate it from [[plutonium]]. It can act as a fluoride ion donor or acceptor (Lewis base or acid), although it does not dissociate appreciably into {{chem|ClF|2|+}} and {{chem|ClF|4|-}} ions.<ref name=Greenwood828>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828–31</ref>

[[Chlorine pentafluoride]] (ClF<sub>5</sub>) is made on a large scale by direct fluorination of chlorine with excess [[fluorine]] gas at 350&thinsp;°C and 250&thinsp;atm, and on a small scale by reacting metal chlorides with fluorine gas at 100–300&thinsp;°C. It melts at −103&thinsp;°C and boils at −13.1&thinsp;°C. It is a very strong fluorinating agent, although it is still not as effective as chlorine trifluoride. Only a few specific stoichiometric reactions have been characterised. [[Arsenic pentafluoride]] and [[antimony pentafluoride]] form ionic adducts of the form [ClF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>[MF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>−</sup> (M = As, Sb) and water reacts vigorously as follows:<ref name=Greenwood832>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832–35</ref>
:2 H<sub>2</sub>O + ClF<sub>5</sub> ⟶ 4 HF + FClO<sub>2</sub>

The product, [[chloryl fluoride]], is one of the five known chlorine oxide fluorides. These range from the thermally unstable FClO to the chemically unreactive [[perchloryl fluoride]] (FClO<sub>3</sub>), the other three being FClO<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>ClO, and F<sub>3</sub>ClO<sub>2</sub>. All five behave similarly to the chlorine fluorides, both structurally and chemically, and may act as Lewis acids or bases by gaining or losing fluoride ions respectively or as very strong oxidising and fluorinating agents.<ref name=Greenwood875>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 875–80</ref>

=== Chlorine oxides ===

[[File:Chlorine dioxide gas and solution.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow [[chlorine dioxide]] (ClO<sub>2</sub>) gas above a yellow chlorine dioxide solution. Solutions of pure chlorine dioxide are dark green: this solution is yellow due to impurities produced from its photodecomposition.]]
[[File:Dichlorine-heptoxide-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|Structure of [[dichlorine heptoxide]], Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, the most stable of the chlorine oxides]]
The [[chlorine oxide]]s are well-studied in spite of their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.<ref name=Greenwood844>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 844–50</ref>

[[Dichlorine monoxide]] (Cl<sub>2</sub>O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) which may be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow [[mercury(II) oxide]]. It is very soluble in water, in which it is in equilibrium with [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), of which it is the anhydride. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make [[hypochlorite]]s. It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas.<ref name=Greenwood844/>

[[Chlorine dioxide]] (ClO<sub>2</sub>) was the first chlorine oxide to be discovered in 1811 by [[Humphry Davy]]. It is a yellow paramagnetic gas (deep-red as a solid or liquid), as expected from its having an odd number of electrons: it is stable towards dimerisation due to the delocalisation of the unpaired electron. It explodes above −40&thinsp;°C as a liquid and under pressure as a gas and therefore must be made at low concentrations for wood-pulp bleaching and water treatment. It is usually prepared by reducing a [[chlorate]] as follows:<ref name=Greenwood844/>
:{{chem|ClO|3|-}} + Cl<sup>−</sup> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> ⟶ ClO<sub>2</sub> + {{sfrac|1|2}} Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
Its production is thus intimately linked to the redox reactions of the chlorine oxoacids. It is a strong oxidising agent, reacting with [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], phosphorus halides, and [[potassium borohydride]]. It dissolves exothermically in water to form dark-green solutions that very slowly decompose in the dark. Crystalline clathrate hydrates ClO<sub>2</sub>·''n''H<sub>2</sub>O (''n'' ≈ 6–10) separate out at low temperatures. However, in the presence of light, these solutions rapidly photodecompose to form a mixture of chloric and hydrochloric acids. Photolysis of individual ClO<sub>2</sub> molecules result in the radicals ClO and ClOO, while at room temperature mostly chlorine, oxygen, and some ClO<sub>3</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> are produced. Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is also produced when photolysing the solid at −78&thinsp;°C: it is a dark brown solid that explodes below 0&thinsp;°C. The ClO radical leads to the depletion of atmospheric ozone and is thus environmentally important as follows:<ref name=Greenwood844/>
:Cl• + O<sub>3</sub> ⟶ ClO• + O<sub>2</sub>
:ClO• + O• ⟶ Cl• + O<sub>2</sub>

[[Chlorine perchlorate]] (ClOClO<sub>3</sub>) is a pale yellow liquid that is less stable than ClO<sub>2</sub> and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and [[dichlorine hexoxide]] (Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>).<ref name=Greenwood844/> Chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of [[perchloric acid]] (HOClO<sub>3</sub>), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include [[chlorine nitrate]] (ClONO<sub>2</sub>, vigorously reactive and explosive), and [[chlorine fluorosulfate]] (ClOSO<sub>2</sub>F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive).<ref name=Greenwood883>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 883–5</ref> Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180&thinsp;°C: it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO<sub>3</sub>, it reacts more as though it were chloryl perchlorate, [ClO<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>[ClO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>−</sup>, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid. It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with anhydrous [[hydrogen fluoride]] does not proceed to completion.<ref name=Greenwood844/>

[[Dichlorine heptoxide]] (Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) is the anhydride of [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>) and can readily be obtained from it by dehydrating it with [[phosphoric acid]] at −10&thinsp;°C and then distilling the product at −35&thinsp;°C and 1&thinsp;mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being the only one to not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO<sub>3</sub> and ClO<sub>4</sub> which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.<ref name=Greenwood844/>

Chlorine forms four oxoacids: [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), [[chlorous acid]] (HOClO), [[chloric acid]] (HOClO<sub>2</sub>), and [[perchloric acid]] (HOClO<sub>3</sub>). As can be seen from the redox potentials given in the adjacent table, chlorine is much more stable towards disproportionation in acidic solutions than in alkaline solutions:<ref name=Greenwood853/>

The hypochlorite ions also disproportionate further to produce chloride and chlorate (3 ClO<sup>−</sup> {{eqm}} 2 Cl<sup>−</sup> + {{chem|ClO|3|-}}) but this reaction is quite slow at temperatures below 70&thinsp;°C in spite of the very favourable equilibrium constant of 10<sup>27</sup>. The chlorate ions may themselves disproportionate to form chloride and perchlorate (4 {{chem|ClO|3|-}} {{eqm}} Cl<sup>−</sup> + 3 {{chem|ClO|4|-}}) but this is still very slow even at 100&thinsp;°C despite the very favourable equilibrium constant of 10<sup>20</sup>. The rates of reaction for the chlorine oxyanions increases as the oxidation state of chlorine decreases. The strengths of the chlorine oxyacids increase very quickly as the oxidation state of chlorine increases due to the increasing delocalisation of charge over more and more oxygen atoms in their conjugate bases.<ref name=Greenwood853/>

Most of the chlorine oxoacids may be produced by exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, [[sodium chlorite]] is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and as a source of chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO<sub>2</sub>) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is [[sodium chlorate]], mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp. The decomposition of chlorate to chloride and oxygen is a common way to produce oxygen in the laboratory on a small scale. Chloride and chlorate may comproportionate to form chlorine as follows:<ref name=Greenwood856>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 856–70</ref>
:{{chem|ClO|3|-}} + 5 Cl<sup>−</sup> + 6 H<sup>+</sup> ⟶ 3 Cl<sub>2</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O

Perchlorates and perchloric acid (HOClO<sub>3</sub>) are the most stable oxo-compounds of chlorine, in keeping with the fact that chlorine compounds are most stable when the chlorine atom is in its lowest (−1) or highest (+7) possible oxidation states. Perchloric acid and aqueous perchlorates are vigorous and sometimes violent oxidising agents when heated, in stark contrast to their mostly inactive nature at room temperature due to the high activation energies for these reactions for kinetic reasons. Perchlorates are made by electrolytically oxidising sodium chlorate, and perchloric acid is made by reacting anhydrous [[sodium perchlorate]] or [[barium perchlorate]] with concentrated hydrochloric acid, filtering away the chloride precipitated and distilling the filtrate to concentrate it. Anhydrous perchloric acid is a colourless mobile liquid that is sensitive to shock that explodes on contact with most organic compounds, sets [[hydrogen iodide]] and [[thionyl chloride]] on fire and even oxidises silver and gold. Although it is a weak ligand, weaker than water, a few compounds involving coordinated {{chem|ClO|4|-}} are known.<ref name=Greenwood856/>

===Organochlorine compounds===
{{main|Organochlorine compound}}
[[File:Phosphorus pentachloride mechanism.png|thumb|upright=2.25|right|Suggested mechanism for the chlorination of a carboxylic acid by phosphorus pentachloride to form an [[acyl chloride]]]]
Like the other carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Cl bond is a common functional group that forms part of core [[organic chemistry]]. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine (3.16) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Cl bond is electron-deficient and thus [[electrophilic]]. [[Chlorination reaction|Chlorination]] modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways: chlorocarbons are typically denser than [[water]] due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen, and aliphatic organochlorides are [[alkylating agent]]s because chloride is a [[leaving group]].<ref name=Ullmann>M. Rossberg et al. "Chlorinated Hydrocarbons" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2}}</ref>

[[Alkanes]] and [[aryl]] alkanes may be chlorinated under [[free-radical]] conditions, with UV light. However, the extent of chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not [[regioselectivity|regioselective]] and often results in a mixture of various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the [[Friedel-Crafts halogenation]], using chlorine and a [[Lewis acid]] catalyst.<ref name=Ullmann/> The [[haloform reaction]], using chlorine and [[sodium hydroxide]], is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as [[phosphorus pentachloride]] (PCl<sub>5</sub>) or [[thionyl chloride]] (SOCl<sub>2</sub>). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and do not have to be distilled out.<ref name=Ullmann/>

Some types of organochlorides, though not all, have significant toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is burned in the presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as [[DDT]], are [[persistent organic pollutant]]s which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species.<ref>{{cite book | title=Introduction to Ecotoxicology | publisher=Blackwell Science | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-632-03852-7 | page=68 | author=Connell, D.|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Due to the ready homolytic fission of the C–Cl bond to create chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere, [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s have been phased out due to the harm they do to the ozone layer.<ref name=Greenwood844/>

==Occurrence and production==
{{Main|Chlorine production|Chloralkali process}}
[[File:Liquid chlorine in flask.jpg|upright|thumb|Liquid chlorine analysis]]
Chlorine is too reactive to occur as the free element in nature but is very abundant in the form of its chloride salts. It is the twentieth most abundant element in Earth's crust and makes up 126&nbsp;[[parts per million]] of it, through the large deposits of chloride minerals, especially [[sodium chloride]], that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground [[brine]] wells, such as the [[Great Salt Lake]] in Utah and the [[Dead Sea]] in Israel.<ref name=Greenwood795>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 795</ref>

Small batches of chlorine gas are prepared in the laboratory by combining hydrochloric acid and [[manganese dioxide]], but the need rarely arises due to its ready availability. In industry, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. This method, the [[chloralkali process]] industrialized in 1892, now provides most industrial chlorine gas.<ref name="Greenwood798"/> Along with chlorine, the method yields [[hydrogen]] gas and [[sodium hydroxide]], which is the most valuable product. The process proceeds according to the following [[chemical equation]]:<ref>{{Holleman&Wiberg|page=408}}</ref>

:2 NaCl + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH

The electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceed according to the following equations:

:Cathode: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 e<sup>−</sup> → H<sub>2</sub> + 2 OH<sup>−</sup>
:Anode: 2 Cl<sup>−</sup> → Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 e<sup>−</sup>

In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an [[asbestos]] (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an [[anode]], preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode.<ref name="Euro Chlor3">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-diaphragm-cell-process.aspx|title=The diaphragm cell process|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111191151/http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-diaphragm-cell-process.aspx|archivedate=2011-11-11|df=}}</ref> The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the [[Causticity|caustic]] [[alkali]] is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, but they are not burdened with the problem of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] disposal and they are more energy efficient.<ref name=Greenwood798/>

Membrane cell electrolysis employs [[Semipermeable membrane|permeable membrane]] as an [[ion exchange]]r. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment, leaving at a lower [[concentration]]. This method also produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide but has the disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations.<ref name="Euro Chlor4">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-membrane-cell-process.aspx|title=The membrane cell process|publisher=Euro Chlor|accessdate=2007-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111190719/http://www.eurochlor.org/the-chlorine-universe/how-is-chlorine-produced/the-membrane-cell-process.aspx|archivedate=2011-11-11|df=}}</ref>

[[File:Chloralkali membrane.svg|center|upright=2.75|thumb|Membrane cell process for chloralkali production]]

In the [[Deacon process]], hydrogen chloride recovered from the production of [[organochlorine compound]]s is recovered as chlorine.  The process relies on oxidation using oxygen:
: 4 HCl + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

The reaction requires a catalyst.  As introduced by Deacon, early catalysts were based on copper.  Commercial processes, such as the Mitsui MT-Chlorine Process, have switched to chromium and ruthenium-based catalysts.<ref name=chlorine>Schmittinger, Peter ''et al.''

==Applications==
Sodium chloride is by a huge margin the most common chlorine compound, and it is the main source of chlorine and hydrochloric acid for the enormous chlorine-chemicals industry today. About 15000 chlorine-containing compounds are commercially traded, including such diverse compounds as chlorinated [[methane]]s and [[ethane]]s, [[vinyl chloride]] and its polymer [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[aluminium trichloride]] for [[catalysis]], the chlorides of [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], and [[hafnium]] which are the precursors for producing the pure elements, and so on.<ref name=Greenwood792/>

Quantitatively, of all elemental chlorine produced, about 63% is used in the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=798}} About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=793}} The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products.<ref name=Greenwood796/> The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are [[1,2-dichloroethane]] and [[vinyl chloride]], intermediates in the production of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Other particularly important organochlorines are [[methyl chloride]], [[methylene chloride]], [[chloroform]], [[vinylidene chloride]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[perchloroethylene]], [[allyl chloride]], [[epichlorohydrin]], [[chlorobenzene]], [[dichlorobenzene]]s, and [[trichlorobenzene]]s. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl<sub>2</sub>O, HOCl, NaClO<sub>3</sub>, chlorinated isocyanurates, [[aluminium chloride|AlCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[silicon tetrachloride|SiCl<sub>4</sub>]], [[tin(IV) chloride|SnCl<sub>4</sub>]], [[phosphorus trichloride|PCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[phosphorus pentachloride|PCl<sub>5</sub>]], [[phosphoryl chloride|POCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[arsenic trichloride|AsCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[antimony trichloride|SbCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[Antimony pentachloride|SbCl<sub>5</sub>]], [[Bismuth chloride|BiCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[disulfur dichloride|S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]], [[sulfur dichloride|SCl<sub>2</sub>]], [[thionyl chloride|SOCI<sub>2</sub>]], [[chlorine trifluoride|ClF<sub>3</sub>]], [[iodine monochloride|ICl]], [[iodine trichloride|ICl<sub>3</sub>]], [[titanium(III) chloride|TiCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[titanium(IV) chloride|TiCl<sub>4</sub>]], [[molybdenum(V) chloride|MoCl<sub>5</sub>]], [[iron(III) chloride|FeCl<sub>3</sub>]], [[zinc chloride|ZnCl<sub>2</sub>]], and so on.<ref name=Greenwood796/>

In France (as elsewhere), [[Catgut|animal intestines]] were processed to make musical instrument strings, [[Goldbeater's skin]] and other products. This was done in "gut factories" (''boyauderies''), and it was an odiferous and unhealthy process. In or about 1820, the [[Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale]] offered a prize for the discovery of a method, chemical or mechanical, for separating the [[Peritoneum|peritoneal]] membrane of animal intestines without [[putrefaction]].<ref name="nbu" /><ref name="knight">{{cite book |author=Knight, Charles |page=427 |title=Arts and sciences |volume=1 |publisher=Bradbury, Evans & Co. |date=1867}}</ref>  The prize was won by [[Antoine-Germain Labarraque]], a 44-year-old French chemist and pharmacist who had discovered that Berthollet's chlorinated bleaching solutions ("''[[Javel water|Eau de Javel]]''") not only destroyed the smell of putrefaction of animal tissue decomposition, but also actually retarded the decomposition.<ref name="knight"/><ref name="bouvet2">{{cite journal |author=Bouvet, Maurice |language=French |trans-title=The great pharmacists: Labarraque (1777–1850) |title=Les grands pharmaciens: Labarraque (1777–1850) |journal=Revue d'Histoire de la Pharmacie |date=1950 |volume=38 |issue=128 |pages=97–107 |doi=10.3406/pharm.1950.8662 |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/pharm_0035-2349_1950_num_38_128_8662 }}</ref>

==== Disinfection ====
Labarraque's chlorinated lime and soda solutions have been advocated since 1828 to prevent infection (called "contagious infection", presumed to be transmitted by "[[miasma theory of disease|miasmas]]"), and to treat [[putrefaction]] of existing wounds, including septic wounds.<ref>Scott, James (trans.).

Highley, 1828) Accessed Nov 1, 2011.</ref> In his 1828 work, Labarraque recommended that doctors breathe chlorine, wash their hands in chlorinated lime, and even sprinkle chlorinated lime about the patients' beds in cases of "contagious infection".  In 1828, the contagion of infections was well known, even though the agency of the [[Microorganism|microbe]] was not discovered until more than half a century later.

During the [[1832 cholera epidemic|Paris cholera outbreak]] of 1832, large quantities of so-called ''chloride of lime'' were used to disinfect the capital. This was not simply modern [[calcium chloride]], but chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute [[calcium hydroxide]]) to form [[calcium hypochlorite]] (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and by doing so, effectively deodorised the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] of Paris.<ref name="corbin">Corbin, Alain (1988).

==== Semmelweis and experiments with antisepsis ====
[[File:Ignaz Semmelweis 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Ignaz Semmelweis]] ]]
Perhaps the most famous application of Labarraque's chlorine and [[base (chemistry)|chemical base]] solutions was in 1847, when [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] used chlorine-water (chlorine dissolved in pure water, which was cheaper than chlorinated lime solutions) to disinfect the hands of Austrian doctors, which Semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition from the dissection rooms to the patient examination rooms. Long before the germ theory of disease, Semmelweis theorized that "cadaveric particles" were transmitting decay from fresh medical cadavers to living patients, and he used the well-known "Labarraque's solutions" as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition (which he found that soap did not). The solutions proved to be far more effective antiseptics than soap (Semmelweis was also aware of their greater efficacy, but not the reason), and this resulted in Semmelweis's celebrated success in stopping the transmission of [[childbed fever]] ("puerperal fever") in the maternity wards of [[Vienna General Hospital]] in [[Austria]] in 1847.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_chlorine/sec_content.asp?CID=1166&DID=4476&CTYPEID=109 |title=Chlorine Story |publisher=americanchemistry |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429214443/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_chlorine/sec_content.asp?CID=1166&DID=4476&CTYPEID=109 |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}</ref>

Much later, during World War I in 1916, a standardized and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, was developed by [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]] (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called [[Dakin's solution]], the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment of a wide variety of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see [[Century Pharmaceuticals]]).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rezayat | first1 = C. | last2 = Widmann | first2 = W.

==== Public sanitation ====

[[File:Liquid Pool Chlorine.jpg|thumb|Liquid Pool Chlorine]]

The first continuous application of chlorination to drinking U.S. water was installed in [[Jersey City]], New Jersey in 1908.<ref>Joseph Cotruvo, Victor Kimm, Arden Calvert. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/drinkingwater.pdf “Drinking Water: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. March 1, 2016.</ref> By 1918, the [[US Department of Treasury]] called for all drinking water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for [[water purification]] (such as in water treatment plants), in [[disinfectant]]s, and in [[bleach]]. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.<ref name=CRC>{{cite book| author = Hammond, C. R.|title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|edition = 81st| publisher =CRC press| date = 2000| isbn = 978-0-8493-0481-1}}</ref>

Chlorine is usually used (in the form of [[hypochlorous acid]]) to kill [[bacteria]] and other microbes in [[drinking water]] supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather [[sodium hypochlorite]], formed from chlorine and [[sodium hydroxide]], or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in human hair and skin. The distinctive 'chlorine aroma' associated with swimming pools is not the result of chlorine itself, but of [[chloramine]], a chemical compound produced by the reaction of free dissolved chlorine with amines in organic substances. As a disinfectant in water, chlorine is more than three times as effective against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' as [[bromine]], and more than six times as effective as [[iodine]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Koski T. A. |author2=Stuart L. S. |author3=Ortenzio L. F.|title=Comparison of chlorine, bromine, iodine as disinfectants for swimming pool water|journal = Applied Microbiology|volume = 14|issue = 2|date = 1966|pages = 276–79|pmid=4959984|pmc=546668}}</ref> Increasingly, [[chloramine]] itself is being directly added to drinking water for purposes of disinfection, a process known as [[chloramination]].{{r|CDC-Chloramination}}

It is often impractical to store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water treatment, so alternative methods of adding chlorine are used. These include [[hypochlorite]] solutions, which gradually release chlorine into the water, and compounds like [[sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione]] (dihydrate or anhydrous), sometimes referred to as "dichlor", and [[trichloro-s-triazinetrione]], sometimes referred to as "trichlor". These compounds are stable while solid and may be used in powdered, granular, or tablet form. When added in small amounts to pool water or industrial water systems, the chlorine atoms hydrolyze from the rest of the molecule forming hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which acts as a general biocide, killing germs, micro-organisms, algae, and so on.{{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=860}}{{sfn|Wiberg|2001|p=411}}

=== Use as a weapon ===

==== World War I ====
{{Main|Chemical weapons in World War I}}

Chlorine gas, also known as bertholite, was first [[chemical warfare|used as a weapon]] in [[World War I]] by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]].<ref>"Battle of Ypres" ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''</ref><ref name=CEN2015>{{cite journal | first = Sarah | last = Everts | url = http://chemicalweapons.cenmag.org/when-chemicals-became-weapons-of-war/ | title = When Chemicals Became Weapons of War | journal = Chemical & Engineering News | volume = 93 | issue = 8 | date = February 23, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160330203223/http://chemicalweapons.cenmag.org/when-chemicals-became-weapons-of-war/ | archivedate = March 30, 2016 | df =  }}</ref> As described by the soldiers, it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung the back of the throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] of the lungs to form [[hydrochloric acid]], destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by [[gas mask]]s with [[activated charcoal]] or other filters, which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, [[Fritz Haber]] of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate [[IG Farben]], which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an [[trench|entrenched]] enemy.<ref>{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC&pg=PA226| page=226| title=Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production| isbn=978-0-262-69313-4| author1=Smil, Vaclav| date=2004-04-01| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220856/https://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC&pg=PA226| archivedate=2015-12-31| df=}}</ref> After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly [[phosgene]] and [[mustard gas]].<ref name="First World War">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm|title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas|publisher=First World War.com|accessdate=2007-08-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821004525/http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm|archivedate=2007-08-21|df=}}</ref>

==== Iraq ====
{{Main|Chlorine bombings in Iraq}}

Chlorine gas was also used during the [[Iraq War in Anbar Province]] in 2007, with insurgents packing [[truck bomb]]s with [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] shells and chlorine tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused by the force of the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.<ref name="cnnchlorine">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/03/17/iraq.main/index.html|last=Mahdi|first=Basim|publisher=CNN|date=2007-03-17|accessdate=2007-03-17|title=Iraq gas attack makes hundreds ill|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317201051/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/03/17/iraq.main/index.html|archivedate=2007-03-17|df=}}</ref><ref name="Chlorine bomb BBC">{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6660585.stm|publisher = BBC News|date = 2007-05-17|accessdate = 2007-05-17|title = 'Chlorine bomb' hits Iraq village|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5v7G8QFjq?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6660585.stm|archivedate = 2010-12-20|df = }}</ref>
