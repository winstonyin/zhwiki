[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|七個國際單位制基本單位的相互定義關係]]

'''國際單位制'''（{{lang-fr|'''S'''ystème '''I'''nternational d'Unités}}，簡稱{{lang|fr|SI}}），<!--稱萬國公制的時候，國際單位制還未建立。
舊稱'''萬國公制'''，<ref name="ROClaw">{{Cite act| year=1929| title=度量衡法| article=2| url=https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/度量衡法_(民國18年)| language=zh| accessdate=2017-02-20}}</ref>-->源於[[公制]]（又稱米制），是世界上最普遍採用的標準[[度量衡]]單位系統。國際單位制以七個[[國際單位制基本單位|基本單位]]為基礎，由此建立起一系列相互換算關係明確的「一致單位」。另有二十個基於[[十進制]]的[[國際單位制詞頭|詞頭]]，當加在單位名稱或符號前的時候，可用於表達該單位的倍數或分數。

國際單位制從1948年開始建立，於1960年正式公佈。它建基於[[米-千克-秒制]]（MKS），而非任何形式的[[厘米-克-秒制]]（CGS）。國際單位制的設計意圖是，先定義詞頭和單位名稱，但單位本身的定義則會隨著度量科技的進步、精準度的提高，根據國際協議來演變。例如，分別於2011年、2014年舉辦的第24、25屆[[國際度量衡大會]]討論了有關重新定義[[公斤]]的提案。<ref name="25th CGPM">{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/25th-CGPM-Convocation.pdf#page=32 |title=Convocation of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (25th meeting) |page=32 |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures |accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref>

隨著科學的發展，厘米-克-秒制中出現了不少新的單位，而各學科之間在單位使用的問題上也沒有良好的協調。因此在1875年，多個國際組織協定《[[米制公約]]》，創立了國際度量衡大會，目的是訂下新度量衡系統的定義，並在國際上建立一套書寫和表達計量的標準。

國際單位制已受大部分[[發達國家]]所採納，但在英語國家當中，國際單位制並沒有受到全面的使用。

[[公制]]最早在1790年代法國大革命期間採用，當時只有[[長度]]和[[質量]]的原器，分別作[[米]]和[[公斤]]的定義標準。<ref group=Note>直至1901年科學家才正式訂下[[質量對重量|質量與重量的差別]]。</ref>1830年代，[[卡爾·弗里德里希·高斯]]為一套建立在長度、質量和[[時間]]上的「一致單位制」打下了根基。1860年代，在英國科學促進協會（{{lang-en|British Association for the Advancement of Science}}）的主持下，一組科學家制訂了一套包含[[國際單位制基本單位|基本單位]]和[[國際單位制導出單位|導出單位]]的一致系統。但當時人們同時使用著多個與[[電]]有關的單位，因此阻礙了將電單位納入這套單位制之中。直到1900年，{{le|喬瓦尼·吉奧爾吉|Giovanni Giorgi}}才提倡在原來的三個基本單位之外再加一個電單位。

1875年，法國根據《[[米制公約]]》把維護公斤和米定義原器的責任轉交給國際組織。1921年，公約適用範圍擴大至所有[[物理量]]，包括最早於1893年定義的各種電單位。

1948年，學者們開始將公制重新制訂為一套「實用單位制」，經過逾十年的發展後，終於在1960年公佈「國際單位制」。1954年第10屆[[國際度量衡大會]]把[[電流]]、[[溫度]]及[[發光強度]]定為基本物理量，使基本物理量增加至六個。相對應的基本單位有[[米]]、[[公斤]]、[[秒]]、[[安培]]、[[開爾文]]和[[坎德拉]]。1971年，國際單位制再添一個基本物理量──以[[摩爾 (單位)|摩爾]]來表示[[物質的量]]。

===早期發展===
1791年，[[法國科學院]]的一個委員會受[[國民議會 (法國)|國民議會]]和[[路易十六]]的委派，開始建立一套統一的、基於理性的度量衡系統，這將成為公制。<ref>{{Cite web

19世紀上半葉，不同基本單位有不同的常用倍數詞頭：法國和德國部分地區常用myriametre（1萬米）量度距離，但在量度質量時卻用kilogram（1千克），而非myriagram（1萬克）。<ref name=Europa1842/>

1832年，德國數學家[[卡爾·弗里德里希·高斯]]在[[威廉·韋伯]]的協助下，得出了[[地球磁場]]的強度，並以毫米、克和秒所組成的單位寫出。秒因此從實際上成為了一個基本單位。<ref name=SIHistory>{{cite web

===米制公約===
{{main article|米制公約}}
法國的度量衡改革啟發了[[計量學]]上的國際合作計劃，多國最終於1875年簽署《[[米制公約]]》。<ref name=Alder/>{{rp|353–354}}公約最初只規定了米和公斤的標準：作為定義標準的共有30件米原器及40件公斤原器，<ref group = Note>《[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/official/metre-convention.pdf 米制公約]》第6.3條對「標準」和「原器」進行區分，前者是法律所規定的計量大小，後者則是標準所根據的原始物體。</ref>材料均為含90%[[鉑]]和10%[[銥]]的合金，由英國[[莊信萬豐]]公司製造，1889年被國際度量衡大會採用。原器中隨機各選出一件分別做[[國際米原器]]和[[國際公斤原器]]，從此取代早前由法國國家檔案館保管的米和公斤原器。公約的每個簽署國都可擁有一個餘下的原器，做該國的定義標準。<ref name="Nelson">{{Cite journal

1921年，米制公約的涵蓋範圍擴展至所有物理單位，包括安培以及其他在1893年美國[[芝加哥]]舉辦的第4屆國際電工大會（{{lang-en|Fourth International Conference of Electricians}}）上所定義的單位。這讓國際度量衡大會能夠解決公制使用上一些不一致的地方。<ref name=LordKelvin>{{cite book

19世紀末，共有三個不同的電單位制在同時使用中，分別為：[[厘米-克-秒制#靜電單位制（ESU）|CGS靜電單位制]]，又稱高斯單位制，簡稱ESU；[[厘米-克-秒制#電磁單位制（EMU）|CGS電機械單位]]，簡稱EMU；以及用於配電系統的[[米-千克-秒制]]（國際單位制）。<ref>{{cite book

19世紀後期至20世紀初期，人們採用了一系列不一致的單位制，在質量上有的用克，有的用公斤；在長度上有的用厘米，有的用米。例如有：表達[[功率]]的「Pferdestärke」（公制[[馬力]]）、<ref>{{cite web

到了[[第二次世界大戰]]尾聲，全球各地仍然使用著各種不同的單位制，有的是公制的另類版本，有的則是基於所謂的「習慣單位」，如[[美制單位]]。1948年，在[[國際純粹與應用物理學聯合會]]及法國政府代表的參與下，第9屆國際度量衡大會委派國際度量衡委員會對科學界、技術界和教育界的計量需求進行一項調查，並為一種單一整合、能供遵守《米制公約》的世界各國使用的單位制提出建議。<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/6/ 9th CGPM (1948): Resolution 6]</ref>

根據此項調查的結論，1954年第10屆國際度量衡大會決定，這個國際性的單位制應以六個基本單位為基礎，能夠用於測量溫度、可見光輻射、機械及電磁物理量。建議中的六個基本單位分別為：米、公斤、秒、安培、開爾文和坎德拉。1960年第11屆國際度量衡大會正式將這一單位制命名為「國際單位制」（{{lang-fr|Le Système International d'Unités}}），簡稱SI。<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|110}}<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/12/ 11th CGPM (1960): Resolution 12]</ref>國際度量衡局也曾把國際單位制稱為「現代公制」。<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|95}}1971年第14屆國際度量衡大會將摩爾納入為第七個基本單位。<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/14/3/ 14th CGPM (1971):Resolution 3]</ref>

===國際物理量系統===
國際物理量系統（{{lang-en|International System of Quantities}}）是以以下七個基本[[物理量]]為基礎的系統：[[長度]]、[[質量]]、[[時間]]、[[電流]]、[[熱力學溫度]]、[[物質的量]]和[[發光強度]]。其他物理量，如[[面積]]、[[壓力]]及[[電阻]]，都可以根據明確、不相互矛盾的公式從這些基本物理量推導得出。國際物理量系統所定義的，是國際單位制單位所量度的物理量。<ref>{{cite book|title=International vocabulary of metrology – Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)|date=2012|publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM):Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology| edition=3rd|url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2015|chapter=1.16}}</ref>[[ISO/IEC 80000]]國際標準對國際物理量系統做了定義，定義於2009年經[[ISO 80000-1]]進一步完善。<ref>S.

===基本單位===
{{main article|國際單位制基本單位}}
國際單位制以一組基本單位為基礎，所有其他單位都是用基本單位建立起來的。馬克士威最初提出一致單位制的概念時，列出了三個可用的基本單位：質量、長度及時間單位。之後，吉奧爾吉提倡加入電的基本單位。理論上，[[電流]]、[[電勢]]、[[電阻]]、[[電荷]]等物理量的單位都可以做基本單位，當選定其中一個做基本單位後，其餘的電單位都可以通過物理定律從基本單位推導得出；國際單位制最終選擇了使用電流。後期又加入了三個分別量度物質的量、溫度及發光強度的基本單位。

===導出單位===
{{main article|國際單位制導出單位}}
[[國際單位制導出單位]]是基本單位在乘冪、乘積或相除後產生的單位，如此形成的導出單位可以有無限多個。<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|103}}<ref name=NIST330/>{{rp|3}}每個導出單位都與一個導出物理量相對應，例如，[[速度]]是建立在時間和長度上的物理量，在國際單位制中所對應的導出單位是「米每秒」（符號為m/s）。導出單位的因次可以用基本單位的因次組合來表達。

一致單位是指定義中系數均為1的導出單位，也就是定義中不會出現像[[標準重力]]或是[[水的密度]]之類的常數。例如，[[牛頓 (單位)|牛頓]]的定義是，使1公斤的質量產生1[[米每二次方秒]]的[[加速度]]需要的力。因為國際單位制中質量及加速度的單位分別是kg及m⋅s<sup>−2</sup>，而且力是質量和加速度之積（{{math|''F'' ∝ ''m'' × ''a''}}），所以力的單位牛頓即為kg⋅m⋅s<sup>−2</sup>。除了基本單位的積和冪以外，牛頓的定義不含其他數值，因此屬於一致單位。

為方便使用，一些導出單位也有專用的名稱及符號。<ref name=special>{{cite journal

===詞頭===
{{main article|國際單位制詞頭}}
Prefixes are added to unit names to produce multiple and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, ''kilo-'' denotes a multiple of a thousand and ''milli-'' denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a ''micrometre'', not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a ''milligram'', not a microkilogram.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|122}}<ref name=NIST811/>{{rp|14}}

===Non-SI units accepted for use with SI===
{{Main article|non-SI units accepted for use with SI}}
The SI is capable of measurement of any physical quantity, but many non-SI units still appear in the scientific, technical, and commercial literature, and will continue to be used for many years. Some units are so deeply embedded in history and many cultures that they will continue to be used for the foreseeable future. The CIPM recognized and acknowledged such traditions by compiling a list of [[non-SI units accepted for use with SI]], which are gouped as follows:<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|123–129}}<ref name=NIST811/>{{rp|7–11}}  <ref group = Note>This grouping and the reference to Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9 reflects the 2014 revision of the 8th Edition of the SI Brochure (2006)</ref>

[[File:CubeLitre.svg|pic|right|thumb|The litre is classed as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI.<br />Being one thousandth of a cubic metre, the litre is not a coherent unit of measure with respect to SI.]]
*'''Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI''' (Table 6):
:Certain units of time, angle, and legacy non-SI metric units have a long history of consistent use. Most societies have used the solar day and its non-decimal subdivisions as a basis of time and, unlike the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], these were the same regardless of where they were being measured. The [[radian]], being {{sfrac|2π}} of a revolution, has mathematical advantages but it is cumbersome for navigation, and, as with time, the units used in navigation have a large degree of consistency around the world. The [[tonne]], [[litre]], and [[hectare]] were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units, having been given unique symbols. The catalogued units are
::[[minute]], [[hour]], [[day]], [[Degree (angle)|degree of arc]], [[minute of arc]], [[Minute of arc|second of arc]], [[hectare]], [[litre]], [[tonne]], [[astronomical unit]] and [[Decibel|[deci]bel]]

* '''Non-SI units whose values in SI units must be obtained experimentally''' (Table 7).
:Physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena, particularly when the quantities associated with these phenomena are many orders of magnitude greater than or less than the equivalent SI unit.  The most common ones have been catalogued in the SI Brochure together with consistent symbols and accepted values, but with the caveat that their values in SI units need to be measured.<ref group = Note>The CGPM have defined the metre in terms of the speed of light, so the speed of light has an exact value.</ref>
::[[electronvolt]] (symbol eV), and [[Atomic mass unit|dalton/unified atomic mass unit]] (Da or u)

* '''Other non-SI units''' (Table 8):
:A number of non-SI units that had never been formally sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including [[health care]] and [[navigation]]. As with the units of measure in Tables 6 and 7, these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage, but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them wherever they are used.
::[[Bar (unit)|bar]], [[millimetre of mercury]], [[Angstrom|ångström]], [[nautical mile]], [[Barn (unit)|barn]], [[knot (unit)|knot]] and [[neper]]

* '''Non-SI units associated with the CGS and the CGS-Gaussian system of units''' (Table 9)
:The SI manual also catalogues a number of legacy units of measure that are used in specific fields such as [[geodesy]] and [[geophysics]] or are found in the literature, particularly in [[Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field#Curved spacetime|classical and relativistic electrodynamics]] where they have certain advantages: The units that are catalogued are:
::[[erg]], [[dyne]], [[poise]], [[Stokes (unit)|stokes]], [[Stilb (unit)|stilb]], [[phot]], [[Gal (unit)|gal]], [[Maxwell (unit)|maxwell]], [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]], and [[oersted|œrsted]].

==Writing unit symbols and the values of quantities {{anchor|SI_writing_style}}==
Before 1948, the use and representation of metric quantities was inconsistent and ambiguous.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 1879, the CIPM published recommendations for writing the symbols for length, area, volume and mass, but it was outside its domain to publish recommendations for other quantities. Beginning in about 1900, physicists who had been using the symbol "μ" for "micrometre" (or "micron"), "λ" for "microlitre", and "γ" for "microgram" started to use the symbols "μm", "μL" and "μg", but it was only in 1935, a decade after the revision of the [[Metre Convention]] that the CIPM formally adopted this proposal and recommended that the symbol "μ" be used universally as a prefix for {{val|e=-6}}.<ref>{{cite book

===Unit names===
Names of [[units of measurement|units]] follow the grammatical rules associated with [[common noun]]s: in English and in French they start with a lowercase letter (e.g., newton, hertz, pascal), even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter. This also applies to "degrees Celsius", since "degree" is the unit.<ref>{{cite web

Likewise, the plural forms of units follow the [[grammar]] of the language concerned: in English, the normal rules of [[English grammar]] are used, e.g. "henries" is the plural of "[[Henry (unit)|henry]]".<ref name=NISTInterprepation>{{Cite journal

|accessdate=28 October 2009}}
</ref><ref name=NIST811/>{{rp|31}} However, the units [[lux]], [[hertz]], and [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] have [[English plural|irregular plurals]] in that they remain the same in both their singular and plural form. Plural forms can be even more complicated in other languages. For example, in Polish the plural form depends on the actual quantity: 0 metrów, 1 metr, 2 metry, 3 metry, 4 metry, 5 metrów, 6 metrów, 7 metrów, 8 metrów, etc. For fractions it is metrów, e.g., 0,67 metrów, 2,45 metrów.

In English, when unit names are combined to denote multiplication of the units concerned, they are separated with a [[hyphen]] or a space (e.g. newton-metre or newton metre).  The plural is formed by converting the last unit name to the plural form (e.g. ten newton-metres).

===Unit names as adjectives===
In English, a space is recommended between the number and the unit symbol when used as an adjective, e.g. "a 25&nbsp;kg sphere".

The normal rules of English apply to unit names, where a hyphen is incorporated into the adjectival sense, e.g. "a 25-kilogram sphere".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us-metric.org/faq-frequently-asked-questions-about-the-metric-system/#spacing|title=U.S. Metric Association FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about the metric system|accessdate=4 May 2016}}</ref>

===Chinese and Japanese===
[[Image:PRC Expressway RoadSign Distances.jpg|thumb|[[China|Chinese]] expressway distances [[Expressways of Beijing|road]] sign in eastern [[Beijing]]. Although the primary text is in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the distances use the internationally recognised [[numerical digit|numerals]] and [[symbol (formal)|symbols]].]]
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] uses traditional [[logogram]]s for writing the unit names, while in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] unit names are written in the phonetic katakana script; in both cases, [[symbol]]s are also written using the internationally recognised [[Latin characters|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek characters]].

;Chinese
The basic Chinese units are metre ({{lang|zh|米}} ''mǐ''), litre ({{lang|zh|升}} ''shēng''), gram ({{lang|zh|克}} ''kè''), and second ({{lang|zh|秒}} ''miǎo''), while others include watt ({{lang|zh|瓦}} ''wǎ''). Prefixes include ''deci-'' ({{lang|zh|分}} ''fēn''), ''centi-'' ({{lang|zh|厘}} ''lí''), ''milli-'' ({{lang|zh|毫}} ''háo''), ''micro-'' ({{lang|zh|微}} ''wēi''), ''kilo-'' ({{lang|zh|千}} ''qiān''), and ''mega-'' ({{lang|zh|兆}} ''zhào''). These are combined to form disyllabic characters, such as {{lang|zh|厘米}} ''límǐ'' "centimetre" or {{lang|zh|千瓦}} ''qiānwǎ'' "kilowatt".<ref>{{cite web

These are generally not used today, but are occasionally found in older or technical writing.<ref name=vmair>Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3330 "Polysyllabic characters in Chinese writing"], ''Language Log'', 2011 August 2</ref>

Some units have different names in [[Taiwan]]. Meter (公尺), centimeter (公分), liter (公升), kilogram (公斤), gram (公克) and hectare (公頃) have the prefix "公", which means "universal". The prefixes "兆", "分" and "厘" are not commonly used, and the use of "千" is limited to kilowatt (千瓦).

;Japanese
A set of [[Kanji|characters]] representing various metric units was [[kokuji|created in Japan]] in the [[Meiji period|late 19th century]]. Characters, same as the Chinese, exist for three base units: the metre ({{lang|ja|米}}), litre ({{lang|ja|升}}) and gram ({{lang|ja|瓦}}). These were combined with a set of six prefix characters – ''kilo-'' ({{lang|ja|千}}), ''hecto-'' ({{lang|ja|百}}), ''deca-'' ({{lang|ja|十}}), ''deci-'' ({{lang|ja|分}}), ''centi-'' ({{lang|ja|厘}}) and ''milli-'' ({{lang|ja|毛}}) – to form an additional 18 single-character units. The seven length units (kilometre to millimetre), for example, are {{lang|ja|粁, 粨, 籵, 米, 粉, 糎}} and {{lang|ja|粍}}. These characters, however, are not in common use today; instead, units are written in [[katakana]], the Japanese [[syllabary]] used for foreign borrowings, such as {{nihongo4|キロメートル|kiromētoru}} for kilometre, but are also written in standard prefixes such as "km" for kilometre. A few Sino-Japanese words for these units remain in use in Japanese, most significantly "{{lang|ja|平米}}" (''heibei'') for "square metre", but otherwise borrowed pronunciations are used.

These characters are examples of the rare phenomenon of [[Ateji#Single-character loan words|single-character loan words]] – a foreign word represented by a single Japanese character – and form the plurality of such words. Similar characters were also coined for other units, such as British units, though these also have fallen out of use; see [[wikt:Appendix:Single character gairaigo#Metric units|Single character gairaigo: Metric units]] and [[wikt:Appendix:Single character gairaigo#Other units|Single character gairaigo: Other units]] for a full list.

===Unit symbols and the values of quantities {{anchor|SI_writing_style}}===
Although the writing of unit names is language-specific, the writing of unit symbols and the values of quantities is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|130–135}} The guideline produced by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)<ref name='nist style'>
{{Cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html |title=NIST Guide to SI Units&nbsp;– Rules and Style Conventions |accessdate=29 December 2009|last1=Thompson|first1=A.|date=July 2008 |last2=Taylor |first2=B. N. |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology }}</ref> clarifies language-specific areas in respect of American English that were left open by the SI Brochure, but is otherwise identical to the SI Brochure.<ref name=NISTInterprepation/>

====General rules====
General rules<ref name=generalrules group=Note>Except where specifically noted, these rules are common to both the SI Brochure and the NIST brochure.</ref> for writing SI units and quantities apply to text that is either handwritten or produced using an automated process:
* The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21&nbsp;kg, {{val|7.3|e=2|u=m<sup>2</sup>}}, 22&nbsp;K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp |134}} and the symbol for degrees of temperature (°C).<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp| 133}} Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°,&nbsp;&prime;, and&nbsp;&Prime;), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.
* Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.
* A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to the unit symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz). Compound prefixes are not allowed.
* Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a [[dot operator|centre dot]] (·) or a non-breaking space; e.g., N·m or N&nbsp;m.
* Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (/), or given as a negative [[exponent]]. E.g., the "metre per second" can be written m/s, m&nbsp;s<sup>−1</sup>, m·s<sup>−1</sup>, or {{sfrac|m|s}}. Only one solidus should be used; e.g., kg/(m·s<sup>2</sup>) and kg·m<sup>−1</sup>·s<sup>−2</sup> are acceptable, but kg/m/s<sup>2</sup> is ambiguous and unacceptable.
[[File:981ms2.png|thumb|Acceleration due to gravity.<br />The lowercase letters (neither "metres" nor "seconds" were named after people), the space between the value and the units, and the superscript "2" to denote "squared".]]
* The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in [[upper case]]; otherwise, they are written in [[lower case]]. E.g., the unit of [[pressure]] is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], so its symbol is written "Pa", but the symbol for mole is written "mol". Thus, "T" is the symbol for [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a measure of [[magnetic field strength]], and "t" the symbol for [[tonne]], a measure of [[mass]]. Since 1979, the [[litre]] may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase "L" or a lowercase "l", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter "l" to the numeral "1", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States "L" be used rather than "l".
* Symbols of units do not have a plural form; e.g., 25&nbsp;kg, not 25&nbsp;{{Not a typo|kgs}}.
* Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the quantities 1&nbsp;mW and 1&nbsp;MW represent two different quantities; the former is the typical power requirement of a hearing aid (1&nbsp;milliwatt or 0.001&nbsp;watts), and the latter the typical power requirement of a suburban train (1&nbsp;megawatt or {{val|1000000}}&nbsp;watts).
* The 10th resolution of [[CGPM]] in 2003 declared that "the symbol for the [[Decimal separator|decimal marker]] shall be either the [[full stop|point]] on the line or the [[comma]] on the line." In practice, the decimal point is used in English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of [[Latin America]] and in continental [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=March–April 2008|title=Period or Comma? Decimal Styles over Time and Place|url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v31n2p042-043.pdf|journal=Science Editor|publisher=Council of Science Editors|volume=31|issue=2|page=42|doi=|pmid=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228062258/http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v31n2p042-043.pdf|archive-date=28 February 2013|access-date=|via=|first1=Amelia A|last1=Williamson|accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref>
* Spaces should be used as a [[thousands separator]] ({{val|1000000}}) in contrast to commas or periods (1,000,000 or 1.000.000) to reduce confusion resulting from the variation between these forms in different countries.
* Any line-break inside a number, inside a compound unit, or between number and unit should be avoided.  Where this is not possible, line breaks should coincide with thousands separators.
* Since the value of "billion" and "trillion" can [[Long and short scales|vary from language to language]], the dimensionless terms "ppb" (parts per [[Billion (word)|billion]]) and "ppt" (parts per [[long and short scales|trillion]]) should be avoided.  No alternative is suggested in the SI Brochure.

====Printing SI symbols====
Further rules<ref name=generalrules group=Note/> are specified in respect of production of text using [[printing press]]es, [[word processor]]s, [[typewriter]]s and the like.
* Symbols are written in upright ([[Roman type|Roman]]) type (m for metres, s for seconds), so as to differentiate from the [[italic type]] used for quantities (''m'' for mass, ''s'' for displacement). By consensus of international standards bodies, this rule is applied independent of the font used for surrounding text.
* In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language]] computing ([[CJK characters|CJK]]), some of the commonly used units, prefix–unit combinations, or unit–exponent combinations have been allocated predefined single characters taking up a full square. [[Unicode]] includes these in its [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3300.pdf CJK Compatibility] and [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2100.pdf letter-like symbols] sub-ranges for back compatibility, without necessarily recommending future usage. These are summarised in [[Unicode symbols]]. The cursive ℓ, a letter-like symbol, has been used in a number of countries in addition to China and Japan as a symbol for the litre, but this is not currently recommended by any [[Standards organization|standards body]].<!--there are lots of standards organisations and I'm pretty sure at least some of them did recommend this in the past; I think South Africa was also big on this-->
*[[Space (punctuation)|In print]], the space used as a thousands separator (commonly called a [[thin space]]) is typically narrower than that used between words.

==Realisation of units==
[[File:Silicon sphere for Avogadro project.jpg|thumb|upright|Silicon sphere for the [[Avogadro project]] used for measuring the Avogadro constant to a relative standard uncertainty of {{val|2|e=−8}} or less, held by [[Achim Leistner]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Avogadro Project | url = http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/mass-and-force/research/avogadro-project | publisher = National Physical Laboratory | accessdate = 19 August 2010}}</ref>]]
Metrologists carefully distinguish between the definition of a unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the ''mise en pratique''<ref group = Note name=Translation>This term is a [[#Metre Convention|translation]] of the official [French] text of the SI Brochure</ref> of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.<ref>{{cite web

The published ''mise en pratique'' is not the only way in which a base unit can be determined: the SI Brochure states that "any method consistent with the laws of physics could be used to realise any SI unit."<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|111}} In the current (2016
) exercise to [[New SI definitions|overhaul the definitions of the base units]], various consultative committees of the CIPM have required that more than one ''mise en pratique'' shall be developed for determining the value of each unit.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  In particular:
* At least three separate experiments be carried out yielding values having a relative standard uncertainty in the determination of the [[kilogram]] of no more than {{val|5|e=-8}} and at least one of these values should be better than {{val|2|e=-8}}.  Both the [[Watt balance]] and the [[Avogadro project]] should be included in the experiments and any differences between these be reconciled.<ref>{{cite web

==Post-1960 changes==
The preamble to the [[Metre Convention]] read "''Desiring the international uniformity and precision in standards of weight and measure, have resolved to conclude a convention ..."''.<ref name=ConventionText/> Changing technology has led to an evolution of the definitions and standards that has followed two principal strands – changes to SI itself and clarification of how to use units of measure that are not part of SI, but are still nevertheless used on a worldwide basis.

===Changes to the SI===
Since 1960 the CGPM has made a number of changes to SI.  These include:
*The 13th CGPM (1967) renamed the "degree Kelvin" (symbol °K) to the "kelvin" (symbol K)<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|156}}
*The 14th CGPM (1971) added the [[Mole (unit)|mole]] (symbol mol) to the list of base units.<ref>pg 221 – McGreevy</ref>
*The 14th GCPM (1971) added the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (symbol Pa) for [[pressure]] and the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] (symbol S) for electrical conductance to the list of named derived units.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|156}}
*The 15th CGPM (1975) added the [[becquerel]] (symbol Bq) for "[[Radioactive decay|activity]] referred to a [[radionuclide]]" and the [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (symbol Gy) for ionizing radiation to the list of named derived units<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|156}}
*In order to distinguish between "[[absorbed dose]]" and "[[dose equivalent]]", the 16th CGPM (1979) added the [[sievert]] (symbol Sv) to the list of named derived units as the unit of dose equivalent.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|158}}
*The 16th CGPM (1979) clarified that in a break with convention either the letter "L" or the letter "l" may be used as a symbol for the [[litre]].<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|159}}
[[File:Clinical Mercury Manometer.jpg|thumb|[[Sphygmomanometer]] – the traditional device that measures blood pressure using [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in a manometer.  Pressures are recorded in "[[Pressure measurement#Liquid column|millimetres of mercury]]" – a non-SI unit]]
*The 21st CGPM (1999) added the [[katal]] (symbol kat) for [[catalytic activity]] to the list of named derived units.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|165}} 
*In its original form (1960), the SI defined prefixes for values ranging from pico- (symbol p) having a value of 10<sup>−12</sup> to tera- (symbol T) having a value of 10<sup>12</sup>. The list was extended at the 12th CGPM (1964),<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|152}} at the 15th CGPM (1975)<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|158}} and at the 19th CGPM (1991)<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|164}} to give the current range of prefixes.

In addition, advantage was taken of developments in technology to redefine many of the base units enabling the use of higher precision techniques.

===Retention of non-SI units===
Although, in theory, SI can be used for any physical measurement, it is recognised that some non-SI units still appear in the scientific, technical and commercial literature, and will continue to be used for many years to come.  In addition, certain other units are so deeply embedded in the history and culture of the human race that they will continue to be used for the foreseeable future.<ref>For instance, [[Tire code|tyre sizes]] on motor vehicles and bicycles tend to have the wheel diameter in inches, and the remaining dimensions in metric.</ref> The CIPM has catalogued such units and included them in the SI Brochure so that they can be used consistently.

The first such group comprises the units of time and of angles and certain legacy non-SI metric units.  Most of mankind has used the day and its subdivisions as a basis of time with the result that the second, minute, hour and day, unlike the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], were the same regardless of where it was being measured. The second has been catalogued as an SI unit, its multiples as units of measure that may be used alongside the SI.  The measurement of angles has likewise had a long history of consistent use – the [[radian]], being {{sfrac|2π}} of a revolution, has mathematical niceties, but it is cumbersome for navigation, hence the retention of the degree, minute and second of arc. The [[tonne]], [[litre]] and [[hectare]] were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units, having been given unique symbols.

Physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena such as the speed of light, the mass of a proton (approximately one [[Dalton (unit)|dalton]]), the charge of an electron and the like.  These too have been catalogued in the SI Brochure with consistent symbols, but with the caveat that their physical values need to be measured.<ref group = Note>The CGPM has defined the metre in terms of the speed of light, so the speed of light has an exact value.</ref>

In the interests of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the [[curie]] (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides;<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp| 152}} the becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years.  Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp| 127}}

Both the degree and rate of adoption of SI varied from country to country—countries that had not adopted the metric system by 1960 and subsequently adopted SI did so directly as part of their metrication programs while others migrated from the [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS system of units]] to SI.

When the SI standard was published in 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of a bill that would have made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time.<ref name=Tavernor/>{{rp|136}} In 1965, after [[Metrication in the United Kingdom|this and similar false starts]] the then [[Federation of British Industry]] informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The [[Board of Trade]], on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset.<ref>{{Cite journal

===European Union===
{{main article|European units of measurement directives}}
In 1960, all the largest industrialised nations that had an established history of using the metric system were members of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).

In 1972, in order to harmonise units of measure as part of a programme to facilitate trade between member states, the EEC issued [[European units of measurement directives|directive 71/354/EEC]].<ref>{{cite web 
|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=DD:I:1971_III:31971L0354:EN:PDF 
|title=Council Directive 71/354/EEC: On the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement |publisher=The Council of the European Communities 
|date=18 October 1971 
|accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>  This directive catalogued units of measure that could be used for "economic, public health, public safety and administrative purposes" and also provided instructions for a transition from the existing units of measure that were in use.  The directive replicated the CGPM SI recommendations and in addition pre-empted some of the additions whose use had been recommended by the CIPM in 1969, but had not been ratified by the CGPM.<ref group = Note>Angular units: degree, minute and second, Units of time:day, minute</ref> The directive also catalogued units of measure whose status would be reviewed by the end of 1977 (mainly coherent CGS units of measure) and also catalogued units of measure that were to be phased out by the end of 1977, including the use of obsolete names for the sale of timber such as the [[stere]], the use of units of force and pressure that made use of the acceleration due to gravity,<ref group = Note>The units that made use of the acceleration due to gravity in their definitions included the [[kilogram-force]]/[[Kilogram-force|kilopond]], [[torr]], [[technical atmosphere]], [[Torr#Manometric units of pressure|manometric units of pressure]] such as metres of water and millimetres of mercury</ref> the use of non-coherent units of power such as the [[Pferdestärke|Pferdestärke (PS)]], the use of the [[calorie]] as a measure of energy and the [[Stilb (unit)|stilb]] as a measure of [[luminance]]. The directive was silent in respect of units that were specific to one or two countries including the ''pond'', ''pfund'', ''livre'' (Dutch, German and French synonyms for 500&nbsp;g), thereby effectively prohibiting their use as well.

When the directive was revisited during 1977, some of the older units that were being reviewed (such as millimetre of mercury for [[blood pressure]])<ref group=Note>The millimetre of mercury for blood pressure is one catalogued in [[#Non-SI units accepted for use with SI|Table 8 of SI Brochure]].</ref> were retained but others were phased out, thereby broadly aligning the allowable units with SI.  The directive was however overhauled to accommodate British and Irish interests in retaining the imperial system in certain circumstances.<ref>{{cite web

The cut-off date for the use of supplementary units was extended a number of times and in 2009 was extended indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1980L0181:20090527:EN:PDF | author = The Council of the European Communities | title = Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to Unit of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC | date=27 May 2009 | accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>

===India===
{{Main article|Metrication in India}}
India was one of the last countries to start a metrication programme before the advent of SI. When it became independent in 1947, both imperial and native units of measure were in use. Its metrication programme started in 1956 with the passing of the Standards of Weights and Measures Act.  Part of the act fixed the value of the [[Seer (unit)|seer]] (a legacy unit of mass) to 0.9331&nbsp;kg exactly; elsewhere the Act declared that from 1960 all non-metric units of measure were to be illegal.<ref>{{cite web

Four years after the [[Government of India|Indian Government]] announced its metrication programme, SI was published. The result was that the initial metrication programme was a conversion to the CGS system of units and the subsequent adoption of SI has been haphazard.  Fifty years later, many of the country's [[Textbook|schoolbooks]] still use CGS or imperial units.<ref>{{cite journal

During the first decade of the 21st century, the [[European Community|EU]] directive [[European units of measurement directives|80/181/EEC]] had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries.<ref name=Gentry2009/> Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the [[Food Marketing Institute]], representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.

Meanwhile, in 1999 the UPLR was amended to permit metric-only labelling and automatically became law in those states that accept UPLR "as is".  By 1 January 2009, 48 out of 50 states permit metric-only labelling, either through UPLR or through their own legislation.<ref name=Gentry2009/> {{As of|2013|February}} the use of metric (and therefore SI) units in the United States does not follow any pattern.

==Redefinition of units==
[[File:Relations between New SI units definitions.svg|thumb |right |Dependencies of proposed SI unit definitions (in colour) and seven [[physical constant]]s (in grey) with fixed numerical values. Unlike the current (2014) definition, the base units are derived from one or more constants of nature.]]
{{main article|New SI definitions}}
After the [[History of the metre|metre was redefined]] in 1960, the kilogram remained the only SI base unit that relied on a specific physical artefact, the [[international prototype of the kilogram]] (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK.<ref name="NPL kg">{{cite web|title=Redefining the kilogram|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/redefining-the-kilogram/|publisher=UK National Physical Laboratory|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

At its 23rd meeting, held in 2007, the CGPM recommended that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that could then be used in the definitions of units of measure in place of the IPK, thus enabling the transition from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions.<ref name="PT Newell">{{cite web|last1=Newell|first1=David B.|title=A more fundamental International System of Units|url=http://www.physics.usu.edu/dennison/3870-3880/Class_Notes/Lectures/Newell%202014%20PhysToday-SI%20Units.pdf|publisher=Physics Today|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=Explicit>{{cite journal|url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2011/3305/4_mills.html|journal = Chemistry International|volume = 33|date=September–October 2011|title = Part II—Explicit-Constant Definitions for the Kilogram and for the Mole|first1 = Ian|last1 = Mills|issn = 0193-6484|pages = 12–15|issue = 5}}</ref>

</ref> The proposals that the CCU put forward were:
*In addition to the speed of light, four constants of nature – the [[Planck constant]], an [[elementary charge]], the [[Boltzmann constant]] and the [[Avogadro number]] – be defined to have exact values.
*The International prototype kilogram be retired
*The current definitions of the kilogram, [[ampere]], [[kelvin]] and [[Mole (unit)|mole]] be revised.
*The wording of the definitions of all the base units be both tightened up and changed to reflect the change in emphasis from explicit unit to explicit constant definitions.

The CIPM meeting of October 2010 reviewed progress towards establishing fixed values for the constants but found that "the conditions set by the General Conference at its 23rd meeting have not yet been fully met. For this reason the CIPM does not propose a revision of the SI at the present time".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/new_si/|title=Towards the "new SI"|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM)|accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref>

At the 24th CGPM meeting, held in October 2011, the CIPM sponsored a resolution in which the requisite definition changes were agreed to in principle and in which the conditions required to be met before the redefinitions could be implemented were restated.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/24_CGPM_Resolution_1.pdf|title=Resolution 1 – On the possible future revision of the International System of Units, the SI|conference=24th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures |location=Sèvres, France |date=17–21 October 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>

By November 2014 the conditions set out at the 23rd meeting of the CGPM for the unit redefinitions had still not been met, and the 25th meeting of the  CGPM, held in November 2014, adopted a similar resolution encouraging further work towards establishing fixed values for the fundamental constants.<ref>{{Cite conference |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/25/1/ |title=Resolution 1 of the 25th CGPM (2014) |conference=25th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures |location=Sèvres, France |date=18–20 November 2014}}</ref>

The formal road map to redefinition includes a special CODATA adjustment of the fundamental constants with a closing date for new data of 1 July 2017 in order to determine the exact numerical values of {{mvar|h}}, {{mvar|e}}, {{mvar|k}} and {{math|''N''<sub>A</sub>}} that will be used to define the New SI. A second CODATA adjustment with a closing date of 1 July 2018 will be carried out so that a complete set of recommended values consistent with the New SI will be available when it is formally adopted by the 26th CGPM.
