'''天文學'''是一門[[自然科學]]，它運用[[數學]]、[[物理]]和[[化學]]等方法來解釋[[宇宙]]間的[[天體]]，包括[[行星]]、[[衛星]]、[[彗星]]、[[恆星]]、[[星系]]等等，以及各種現象，如[[超新星|超新星爆炸]]、[[伽瑪射線暴]]、[[宇宙微波背景輻射]]等等。廣義地來說，任何源自[[地球大氣層]]以外的現象都屬於天文學的研究範圍。[[物理宇宙學]]與天文學密切相關，但它把宇宙視為一個整體來研究。<ref>{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System - Introduction|date=2001|pages=1}}</ref>

天文學有著遠古的歷史。自有文字記載起，[[巴比倫天文學|巴比倫]]、[[古希臘天文學|古希臘]]、[[印度天文學|印度]]、[[古埃及天文學|古埃及]]、[[努比亞]]、[[伊朗人|伊朗]]、[[中國天文學|中國]]、[[瑪雅文明|瑪雅]]以及許多古代[[美洲原住民|美洲文明]]就有對[[夜空]]做詳盡的觀測記錄。天文學在歷史上還涉及到[[天體測量學]]、[[天文航海]]、[[觀測天文學]]和[[曆法]]的制訂，今天則一般與[[天體物理學]]同義。<ref>{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System|date=2001|pages=6–9}}</ref>

到了20世紀，天文學逐漸分為觀測天文學與理論天文學兩個分支。觀測天文學以取得天體的觀測數據為主，再以基本物理原理加以分析；理論天文學則開發用於分析天體現象的電腦模型和分析模型。兩者相輔相成，理論可解釋觀測結果，觀測結果可證實理論。

與不少現代科學範疇不同的是，天文學仍舊有比較活躍的業餘社群。業餘天文學家對天文學的發展有著重要的作用，特別是在發現和觀察彗星等短暫的天文現象上。

早期天文學只能對肉眼可見的天體作預測。某些古代文化建造過可能具有天文觀測作用的巨大建築物，除了可以舉行儀式以外，還能用於判斷季節、耕收的日期以及一年的時長。<ref name="history">Forbes, 1909</ref>

在望遠鏡發明之前，人們只能用肉眼觀察夜空。在[[美索不達米亞]]、[[古希臘]]、[[波斯]]、[[印度]]、[[中國]]、[[古埃及]]和[[瑪雅文明|中美洲]]等地，人們開始建造天文台，思索宇宙的本質。早期天文學以記錄恆星和行星在天上的位置為主，今天這項範疇稱為[[天體測量學]]。在這些觀測的基礎上，開始萌發出有關行星的運動、日月地在宇宙中的地位等的哲學思想。不少文化把地球視為宇宙的中心，日月星辰皆繞地球旋轉，是為[[地心說]]。<ref>{{cite book|last=DeWitt|first=Richard|title=Worldviews: An Introduction to the History and Philosophy of Science|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, England|isbn=1-4051-9563-0|page=113|chapter=The Ptolemaic System}}</ref>

[[File:Medieval Astronomy (f.4v).jpg|thumb|歐洲早期天圖，約1000年]]
[[文藝復興]]期間，[[Nicolaus Copernicus]]提出[[太陽系]][[日心說]]。[[Galileo Galilei]]和[[Johannes Kepler]]再在哥白尼的基礎上進一步完善日心說。伽利略首次利用望遠鏡觀察天體，發現月球表面佈滿了凹凸的山，而不是光滑一片。<ref name="f58-64"/>

開普勒Kepler was the first to devise a system that described correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down.<ref>Forbes, 1909, pp. 49–58</ref> It was left to [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] invention of [[celestial dynamics]] and his [[gravity|law of gravitation]] to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the [[reflecting telescope]].<ref name="f58-64">Forbes, 1909, pp. 58–64</ref>

The English astronomer [[John Flamsteed]] catalogued over 3000 stars.<ref>Chambers, Robert (1864) ''[[Chambers Book of Days]]''</ref> Further discoveries paralleled the improvements in the size and quality of the telescope. More extensive star catalogues were produced by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|Lacaille]]. The astronomer [[William Herschel]] made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet [[Uranus]], the first new planet found.<ref>Forbes, 1909, pp. 79–81</ref> The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the [[parallax]] of [[61 Cygni]] was measured by [[Friedrich Bessel]].<ref>Forbes, 1909, pp. 147–150</ref>

During the 18–19th centuries, the study of the [[three body problem]] by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[Alexis Claude Clairaut|Clairaut]], and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]], allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.<ref>Forbes, 1909, pp. 74–76</ref>

Significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the [[spectroscope]] and [[Astrophotography|photography]]. [[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]] discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of [[temperature]]s, [[mass]]es, and sizes.<ref name="short history" />

The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], as a separate group of stars, was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of "external" galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the [[Universe]].<ref name=Belkora2003>{{cite book|author=Belkora, Leila|title=Minding the heavens: the story of our discovery of the Milky Way|isbn=978-0-7503-0730-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qBM-wez94WwC&printsec=frontcover|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|date=2003|pages=1–14}}</ref> Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as [[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s, which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[blazar]]s, and [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]]. [[Physical cosmology]] made huge advances during the 20th century, with the model of the [[Big Bang]], which is heavily supported by evidence provided by [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], [[Hubble's law]], and the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|cosmological abundances of elements]]. [[Space telescope]]s have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere. In February 2016, it was revealed that the [[LIGO]] project had detected evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the previous September.

==Observational astronomy==
{{Main article|Observational astronomy}}

Our main source of information about [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] and other objects is visible [[light]] more generally [[electromagnetic radiation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html|title=Electromagnetic Spectrum|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905131651/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html|archivedate=5 September 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Observational astronomy may be divided according to the observed region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Although some [[radio wave]]s are emitted directly by astronomical objects, a product of [[black body radiation|thermal emission]], most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of [[synchrotron radiation]], which is produced when [[electron]]s orbit [[magnetic field]]s.<ref name="cox2000"/> Additionally, a number of [[spectral line]]s produced by [[interstellar gas]], notably the [[hydrogen]] spectral line at 21&nbsp;cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.<ref name="shu1982"/><ref name="cox2000"/>

Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of [[infrared]] radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, [[circumstellar disk]]s or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in [[molecular cloud]]s and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic [[protostar]]s and their host [[star clusters]].<ref name="wright">{{cite web|url=http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/|title=Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Mission|last=|first=|date=30 September 2014|publisher=[[NASA]][[University of California, Berkeley]]|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=ma2013>Majaess, D.

Historically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy.<ref name="moore1997">{{cite book
|author=Moore, P.
|title=Philip's Atlas of the Universe

|isbn=0-540-07465-9}}</ref> Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 [[Ångstrom|Å]] to 7000 Å (400 [[nanometre|nm]] to 700&nbsp;nm),<ref name="moore1997"/> that same equipment can be used to observe some [[near-ultraviolet]] and [[near-infrared]] radiation.

===Ultraviolet astronomy===
{{Main article|Ultraviolet astronomy}}

Ultraviolet astronomy employs [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200&nbsp;Å (10 to 320&nbsp;nm).<ref name="cox2000"/> Light at those wavelengths are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue [[star]]s ([[OB star]]s) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include [[planetary nebula]]e, [[supernova remnant]]s, and active galactic nuclei.<ref name="cox2000"/> However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by [[interstellar dust]], an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.<ref name="cox2000"/>

Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by [[synchrotron emission]] (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), [[bremsstrahlung radiation|thermal emission from thin gases]] above 10<sup>7</sup> (10&nbsp;million) [[kelvin]]s, and [[blackbody radiation|thermal emission from thick gases]] above 10<sup>7</sup> Kelvin.<ref name="cox2000"/> Since X-rays are absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], all X-ray observations must be performed from [[high-altitude balloon]]s, [[rocket]]s, or [[X-ray astronomy satellite]]s. Notable [[Astrophysical X-ray source|X-ray source]]s include [[X-ray binaries]], [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova remnant]]s, [[elliptical galaxies]], [[clusters of galaxies]], and [[active galactic nuclei]].<ref name="cox2000"/>

===Gamma-ray astronomy===
{{Main article|Gamma ray astronomy}}
Gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] or by specialized telescopes called [[atmospheric Cherenkov telescope]]s.<ref name="cox2000"/> The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.<ref name="spectrum">{{cite web|url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&style=feature|title=The electromagnetic spectrum|last=Penston|first=Margaret J.|date=14 August 2002|website=|publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908014227/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&style=feature|archive-date=8 September 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>

Most [[Gamma ray|gamma-ray]] emitting sources are actually [[gamma-ray burst]]s, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]] candidates such as active galactic nuclei.<ref name="cox2000"/>

===Fields not based on the electromagnetic spectrum===
In addition to electromagnetic radiation, a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth.

In [[neutrino astronomy]], astronomers use heavily shielded [[Neutrino observatory|underground facilities]] such as [[SAGE (ruSsian American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]], [[GALLEX]], and [[Kamioka Observatory|Kamioka II/III]] for the detection of [[neutrino]]s. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the [[Sun]], but 24 neutrinos were also detected from [[supernova 1987A]].<ref name="cox2000"/> [[Cosmic ray]]s, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories.<ref>{{cite book

[[Gravitational-wave astronomy]] is an emerging field of astronomy that employs [[gravitational-wave detector]]s to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the ''Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory'' [[LIGO]]. LIGO made its [[First observation of gravitational waves|first detection]] on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a [[binary black hole]].<ref name="PRL-20160211">{{cite journal | collaboration = LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Benjamin P.  |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

===Astrometry and celestial mechanics===
{{Main article|Astrometry|Celestial mechanics}}
[[File:EmissionNebula NGC6357.jpg|right|thumb|Star cluster [[Pismis 24]] with a nebula]]
One of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in [[celestial navigation]] (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of [[calendar]]s.

Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational [[Perturbation theory|perturbations]], and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as [[celestial mechanics]]. More recently the tracking of [[near-Earth object]]s will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.<ref>{{cite web|last = Calvert|first = James B.|date = 28 March 2003|url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm|title = Celestial Mechanics|publisher = University of Denver|accessdate =21 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060907120741/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm| archivedate= 7 September 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The measurement of [[stellar parallax]] of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the [[cosmic distance ladder]] that is used to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the [[radial velocity]] and [[proper motion]] of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html|title=Hall of Precision Astrometry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[University of Virginia]] Department of Astronomy|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826104509/http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html|archivedate=26 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

==Theoretical astronomy==
{{Nucleosynthesis}}
{{Main article|Theoretical astronomy}}
Theoretical astronomers use several tools including [[mathematical model|analytical models]] and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]; each has its particular advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved.<ref>{{cite journal|first=H.|last=Roth|title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability|journal=Physical Review |volume=39|issue=3|pages=525–529|date=1932|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525|bibcode = 1932PhRv...39..525R }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=A.S.|last=Eddington|title=Internal Constitution of the Stars|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1926|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hJW3JbhnFQMC&pg=PA182|isbn=978-0-521-33708-3}}</ref>

Theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Phenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include: [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]]; [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]]; [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale distribution]] of [[matter]] in the [[Universe]]; origin of [[cosmic ray]]s; [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] [[cosmology]] and [[astroparticle physics]]. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')[[physics]] and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]] are the [[Big Bang]], [[Cosmic inflation]], [[dark matter]], and fundamental theories of [[physics]].

At a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the [[Sun]], a typical main-sequence [[dwarf star]] of [[stellar class]] G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a [[variable star]], but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the [[sunspot cycle]]. This is an 11-year oscillation in [[Wolf number|sunspot number]].

The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the [[photosphere]]. Above this layer is a thin region known as the [[chromosphere]]. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated [[corona]].

At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur. Above the core is the [[radiation zone]], where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the [[convection zone]] where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.<ref name="solar FAQ" />

A solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]]. As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] ([[magnetosphere]]) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s that envelop the Earth . The [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines the descend into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite web|author = Stern, D.

The planets were formed 4.6 billion years ago in the [[protoplanetary disk]] that surrounded the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The [[radiation pressure]] of the [[solar wind]] then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many [[impact crater]]s on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have [[giant impact hypothesis|formed the Moon]].<ref name=Montmerle2006>{{cite journal|last=Montmerle|first=Thierry|author2=Augereau, Jean-Charles|author3= Chaussidon, Marc|title=Solar System Formation and Early Evolution: the First 100 Million Years|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|volume=98|issue=1–4|publisher=Springer|pages=39–95|date=2006|doi=10.1007/s11038-006-9087-5| bibcode=2006EM&P...98...39M|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Once a planet reaches sufficient mass, the materials of different densities segregate within, during [[planetary differentiation]]. This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores generate their own [[magnetic field]], which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping.<ref>Montmerle, 2006, pp. 87–90</ref>

A planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body, by the decay of radioactive materials (''e.g.'' [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[Aluminium#Isotopes|<sup>26</sup>Al]]), or [[tidal acceleration|tidal heating]] caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as [[volcanism]] and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an [[atmosphere]] can also undergo surface [[erosion]] from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering.<ref name="new solar system">{{cite book| editor=Beatty, J.K.| editor2=Petersen, C.C.| editor3=Chaikin, A.|title=The New Solar System|publisher=Cambridge press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iOezyHMVAMcC&pg=PA70|page=70edition = 4th|date=1999|isbn =0-521-64587-5}}</ref>

[[File:Ant Nebula.jpg|thumb|The [[Mz3|Ant planetary nebula]]. Ejecting gas from the dying central star shows symmetrical patterns unlike the chaotic patterns of ordinary explosions.]]
{{Main article|Star}}
The study of stars and [[stellar evolution]] is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior.<ref name=Amos7>Harpaz, 1994, pp. 7–18</ref> [[Star formation]] occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as [[Dark nebula|giant molecular clouds]]. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a [[protostar]]. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger [[nuclear fusion]], thus creating a [[main-sequence star]].<ref name=Smith2004/>

Almost all elements heavier than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were [[nucleosynthesis|created]] inside the cores of stars.<ref name=Amos7/>

The characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to [[Stellar evolution|evolve]]. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting [[red giant]] formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.<ref name=Amos>Harpaz, 1994</ref>

The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the Sun becoming core collapse [[supernova]]e;<ref>Harpaz, 1994, pp. 173–178</ref> while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave behind the inert core in the form of a [[white dwarf]].

===Galactic astronomy===

{{Main article|Galactic astronomy}}
Our [[solar system]] orbits within the [[Milky Way]], a [[barred spiral galaxy]] that is a prominent member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.

In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a [[supermassive black hole]] at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, [[Stellar population|population I]] stars. The disk is surrounded by a [[Galactic spheroid|spheroid halo]] of older, [[population II]] stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as [[globular cluster]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php|title=The Galactic Centre|last=Ott|first=Thomas|date=24 August 2006|website=|publisher=Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904140550/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php|archivedate=4 September 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Between the stars lies the [[interstellar medium]], a region of sparse matter. In the densest regions, [[molecular cloud]]s of [[Hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact [[pre-stellar core]] or [[dark nebula]]e, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the [[Jeans length]]) to form compact protostars.<ref name=Smith2004>{{cite book|first=Michael David|last=Smith|date=2004| pages=53–86|title=The Origin of Stars|chapter=Cloud formation, Evolution and Destruction| publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-501-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UVgBoqZg8a4C&dq}}</ref>

As the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an [[H II region]] (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The [[Solar wind|stellar wind]] and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young [[open cluster]]s of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael David|last=Smith|date=2004| pages=185–199|title=The Origin of Stars|chapter=Massive stars

Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A [[dark matter halo]] appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Van den Bergh, Sidney|title=The Early History of Dark Matter|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=1999|volume=111|issue=760|pages=657–660|doi=10.1086/316369|arxiv = astro-ph/9904251 |bibcode = 1999PASP..111..657V }}</ref>

===Extragalactic astronomy===

{{Main article|Extragalactic astronomy}}
The study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of Galaxies]], their morphology (description) and [[Galaxy morphological classification|classification]], the observation of [[Active galaxy|active galaxies]], and at a larger scale, the [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters of galaxies]]. Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].

Most [[galaxy|galaxies]] are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes. They are commonly divided into [[spiral galaxy|spiral]], [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and [[irregular galaxy|Irregular]] galaxies.<ref>{{cite web|last = Keel|first = Bill|date = 1 August 2006|url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html|title = Galaxy Classification|publisher = University of Alabama|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901074027/http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html| archivedate= 1 September 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

As the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an [[ellipse]]. The stars move along [[randomness|random]] orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.

A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], are spiral galaxies.

Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.

An active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.

A [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the [[radio]] portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]], [[Quasar]]s, and [[Blazar]]s. Quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/active_galaxies.html|title=Active Galaxies and Quasars|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831033713/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/active_galaxies.html|archivedate=31 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

The [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the [[supercluster]]s. The collective matter is formed into [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and walls, leaving large [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] between.<ref name="evolving universe">{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Zeilik|title=Astronomy: The Evolving Universe|edition=8th|publisher=Wiley|date=2002|isbn=0-521-80090-0}}</ref>

===Physical cosmology===
{{Nature timeline}}
{{Main article|Physical cosmology}}
[[Cosmology]] (from the Greek κόσμος (''kosmos'') "world, universe" and λόγος (''logos'') "word, study" or literally "logic") could be considered the study of the Universe as a whole.
[[File:Hubble Extreme Deep Field (full resolution).png|thumb|left|250px|[[Hubble Extreme Deep Field]]]]

Observations of the [[large-scale structure of the Universe]], a branch known as [[physical cosmology]], have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the [[big bang]], wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] over the course of 13.8 billion years<ref>{{cite web

|title = Cosmic Detectives

</ref> to its present condition.<ref name=Dodelson2003/> The concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] in 1965.<ref name=Dodelson2003>{{cite book|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|pages=1–22}}</ref>

In the course of this expansion, the Universe underwent several evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the Universe experienced a very rapid [[cosmic inflation]], which homogenized the starting conditions. Thereafter, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] produced the elemental abundance of the early Universe.<ref name=Dodelson2003/> (See also [[nucleocosmochronology]].)

When the first neutral [[atom]]s formed from a sea of primordial ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.<ref name="cosmology 101">{{cite web|last = Hinshaw|first = Gary|date = 13 July 2006|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html|title = Cosmology 101: The Study of the Universe|publisher = NASA WMAP|accessdate =10 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060813053535/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html| archivedate= 13 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

A hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the [[Population III stars]]. These massive stars triggered the [[reionization]] process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.<ref>Dodelson, 2003, pp. 216–261</ref>

Gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters]] of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html|title = Galaxy Clusters and Large-Scale Structure|publisher = University of Cambridge|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061010041120/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html| archivedate= 10 October 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Fundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.<ref>{{cite web|last = Preuss|first = Paul|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html|title = Dark Energy Fills the Cosmos|publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Berkeley Lab|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060811215815/http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html| archivedate= 11 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Interdisciplinary studies==
Astronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. [[Archaeoastronomy]] is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] evidence. [[Astrobiology]] is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. [[Astrostatistics]] is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.

The study of [[chemical]]s found in space, including their formation, interaction and destruction, is called [[astrochemistry]]. These substances are usually found in [[molecular cloud]]s, although they may also appear in low temperature stars, brown dwarfs and planets. [[Cosmochemistry]] is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the [[isotope]] ratios. Both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry. As "[[forensic astronomy]]", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history.

==Amateur astronomy==
{{Main article|Amateur astronomy}}
[[File:Telescope trailer 22.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Amateur astronomers can build their own equipment, and hold star parties and gatherings, such as [[Stellafane]].]]
Astronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most.<ref>{{cite journal

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with [[Amateur telescope making|equipment that they build themselves]]. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep-sky object]]s such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amsmeteors.org/|title = The American Meteor Society|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060822135040/http://www.amsmeteors.org/| archivedate= 22 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Jerry|last=Lodriguss|url=http://www.astropix.com/|title = Catching the Light: Astrophotography|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901185541/http://www.astropix.com/| archivedate= 1 September 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]], who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (''e.g.'' the [[One-Mile Telescope]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Ghigo, F.|date = 7 February 2006|url=http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml|title = Karl Jansky and the Discovery of Cosmic Radio Waves|publisher = National Radio Astronomy Observatory|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060831105945/http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml| archivedate= 31 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~arcus/cara/|title = Cambridge Amateur Radio Astronomers|accessdate =24 August 2006 }}</ref>

Amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm|title = The International Occultation Timing Association|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060821180723/http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm| archivedate= 21 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbat.eps.harvard.edu/special/EdgarWilson.html |title=Edgar Wilson Award |publisher=IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams |accessdate=24 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024202325/http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/special/EdgarWilson.html |archivedate=24 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/|title = American Association of Variable Star Observers|publisher = AAVSO|accessdate =3 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100202050715/http://www.aavso.org/| archivedate= 2 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Unsolved problems in astronomy==
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in physics}}
Although the scientific discipline of [[Unsolved problems in astronomy|astronomy]] has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.
