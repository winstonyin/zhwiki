在[[奧斯曼帝國]][[聯合進步委員會]]領導下發生的[[亞美尼亞種族滅絕]]期間，帝國內的亞美尼亞裔婦女遭受了系統性的[[種族滅絕式強姦]]，以及學者所謂「種族滅絕工具」的各種暴力行為，包括綁架、[[強迫賣淫]]、{{le|性殘割|sexual mutilation}}以及與施暴者[[強迫婚姻]]。{{efn|「殘暴婦女是亞美尼亞種族滅絕的核心特徵。在殺害亞美尼亞領導和青壯年男性之後，奧斯曼當局和聯合主義支持者便將亞美尼亞裔生還者從[[阿納托利亞]]驅逐到敘利亞沙漠裡。目擊者敘述和外交報告都揭示了性別在種族滅絕迫害期間的作用。」{{sfn|Derderian|2005|pp=1–25}} }}{{sfn|Herzog|2011|p=47}}{{sfn|Miller|Miller|1999|p=24}}

德國駐[[特拉布宗]]領事在報告中寫到了「許多女人和女孩被強姦」的事跡，這種罪行在他看來是「幾乎徹底殲滅亞美尼亞人」計劃的一部分。種族滅絕期間進行系統性強姦的手段，已被土耳其、美國、奧地利及德國的目擊者和官員證實。{{sfn|Dadrian|2008|p=83}}

== 背景 ==
1850至1870年間，亞美尼亞[[卡托利科斯]]共537次致函奧斯曼帝國[[高門 (奧斯曼帝國)|高門]]求助，請求保護亞美尼亞人免受暴力虐待以及社會政治不公，包括「針對婦女和兒童的掠奪、謀殺、綁架和強姦，變相充公財產的稅賦，以及地方官員的詐騙和勒索」。{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=37}}

亞美尼亞人在{{le|奧斯曼帝國律法|Ottoman law}}底下有一定的自治權，比如有自己的監獄和法庭，也可以自行對[[基督徒]]和[[穆斯林]]之間的民事官司進行審判。然而在伊斯蘭教律法下，亞美尼亞人是毫無權利的：穆斯林可以要求受宗教法庭審判，而非穆斯林的證言在宗教法庭上是沒有份量的。一個穆斯林只要對《[[可蘭經]]》宣誓，就可以解決官司。因此，包括亞美尼亞人在內的[[齊米]]無法得到司法系統的保護。美國亞美尼亞裔詩人作家[[彼得·巴拉希揚]]寫道：「一個身懷武器的庫爾德人或者土耳其人不但可以搶掠接待他的（亞美尼亞裔）主人的財物，而且還可以強姦主人家裡的婦女，卻不受懲罰。」{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=42}}「在奧斯曼帝國如此的司法系統下所承受的盜竊和勒索、婦女所面對的強姦和綁架，足以使亞美尼亞人永無寧日。」{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=41}}

1895年，弗雷德里克·戴維斯·格林（{{lang-en|Frederick Davis Greene}}）的《土耳其的亞美尼亞危機：1894年屠殺之緣由與意義》{{lang-en|''The Armenian Crisis in Turkey: The Massacre of 1894, Its Antecedents and Significance''}}出版，其中講述了男人被直接殘殺，而婦女和兒童則慘遭強暴的情況。{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=64}}他描述了一件個例：

<blockquote>許多婦女，粗略估計有60至160人不等，被關在一所教堂裡。士兵聽令可「隨意放肆」。許多婦女被強暴致死，其餘的則以利劍、刺刀對待。年少者被排成一排，一個站在一個身後，然後用槍成串射擊，似是要看看一顆子彈能打死多少個。嬰兒和小孩被一個個堆起來，被擊頭而死。{{sfn|Balakian|2004|p=64}}{{sfn|Jacobs|2003|pp=129–130}}</blockquote>

1915年的屠殺是早有預謀的。[[英國海軍]]志願軍指揮官C·H·希思科特·史密斯（{{lang-en|C. H. Heathcote Smith}}）的報告直接翻譯了奧斯曼的官方文件，寫明種族滅絕的詳細措施，被稱為《聯合進步委員會之十誡》：

<blockquote>
# 利用聯合進步委員會第三及第四條，關閉一切亞美尼亞社團，逮捕任何時候做過反政府工作的社團成員，並將其遣送往其他省份，如[[巴格達]]或[[摩蘇爾]]，然後在路上或在當地消滅之。
# 繳納兵器。
# 以適當的特殊方式激發穆斯林民憤，如在[[凡州|凡]]、[[埃爾祖魯姆]]、[[阿達納]]等穆斯林已仇恨亞美尼亞人的地方，像俄羅斯在[[巴庫]]的做法一樣煽動有組織的屠殺。
# 把一切執行權交給埃爾祖魯姆、凡、[[埃拉澤|馬穆雷特埃拉澤]]及[[比特利斯]]等省人，並用軍方紀律部隊（即憲兵），表面上是要阻止屠殺，實際上反之在阿達納、[[錫瓦斯]]、[[布爾薩]]、[[伊茲密特]]及[[土麥那]]等地積極軍事協助穆斯林施暴。
# 實施政策殲滅所有五十歲以下男性、牧師和老師，並留下婦女和兒童受伊斯蘭化。
# 趕走所有成功逃脫者的家人，將其與祖籍地斷絕一切聯繫。
# 在亞美尼亞裔官員有可能為間諜的地方，要從每個政府部門和崗位徹底將其驅逐出去。
# 用適當方式殺死軍隊裡的所有亞美尼亞人，此事交給軍隊實施。
# 所有措施應在所有地方同時開始，意在讓人沒有時間防備。
# 注意這些指示必須嚴格保密，不許傳達超過兩至三個人。{{sfn|Dadrian|1993|pp=174–175}}</blockquote>

種族滅絕行動隨著[[第一次世界大戰]]的爆發開始，在奧斯曼軍隊裡服役的亞美尼亞人被解除職務或殺害，亞美尼亞裔平民被迫離鄉，又被拒絕提供糧食和水。亞美尼亞人被趕到沙漠裡，這和[[德意志帝國]]在[[德屬西南非洲]]實施的[[赫雷羅人和納馬人大屠殺]]手段相似。遠征過程中的婦女和小孩都被系統性地強暴、殘骸和拷打。被迫遠征而死的受害者有數十萬之多。{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=18}}

== 種族滅絕式強姦 ==
{{main|種族滅絕式強姦}}

During the Armenian genocide the rape of young girls was well documented; they would be assaulted in their homes before forced relocation, or on the forced marches into the Syrian desert. An eyewitness testified, "It was a very common thing for them to rape our girls in our presence. Very often they violated eight or ten year old girls, and as a consequence many would be unable to walk, and were shot." Another testified that every girl in her village aged over twelve, and some who were younger, had been raped.{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=94}}

Women were gang raped and often committed suicide afterwards.{{Explain|date=March 2021|reason=How common was this? Add example or elaboration?}} Once the men had been separated from the women, the women were systematically raped and then killed, along with any children.{{sfn|Joyce Frey|2009|p=80}}{{sfn|Monroe|2011|p=14}} According to eyewitness accounts, the practice of rape was "more or less universal".{{sfn|Theriault|2007|p=30}} Armenians "were often killed in festivals of cruelty which involved rape and other forms of torture."{{sfn|Theriault|2007|p=29}} The women were raped on a daily basis, and many were forced to work as prostitutes. Many were killed by bayoneting, or died from exposure or from prolonged sexual abuse.{{sfn|Khosroeva|2007|p=280}}

In 2008, A. Dirk Moses described genocide as a "total social practice."{{sfn|Moses|2008|p=13}} Within this context, rape can be viewed as an integral part of genocide. Genocides usually involve attacking the familial roles of the victims, which are the ways they contribute to the reproduction of the targeted group as perceived by the perpetrators. Commonalities across all genocides are the murder of infants in front of parents, forced rape of women by family members, and the violation and mutilation of the reproductive systems.{{sfn|Von Joeden-Forgey|2010|p=72}} 

The Armenian genocide is a prime example of these behaviors. The attackers follow a pattern of family based destruction. In attacks on villages men were killed, and the surviving population were raped, forcibly displaced or killed. Another purpose of the rapes was [[eliticide]], the destruction of a group's leadership, which was then used to create confusion. This gave a public demonstration of the mastery the attackers had over the Armenian populace, and caused "total suffering" on both sexes, as they bore witness to sexual assault and the torture of those they loved.{{sfn|Von Joeden-Forgey|2010|pp=72–73}}

=== Instances and accounts ===

According to [[Taner Akçam]], forced prostitution, rape and sexual abuse were widespread, and military commanders told their men to "Do to them whatever you wish". Members of the German armed forces in [[Der Zor]] helped to open a brothel. Throughout the genocide the men were given free licence to do as they pleased with Armenian women.{{sfn|Akçam|2012|p=312}} Armenian women and children were displayed naked in auctions in [[Damascus]], where they were sold as [[Islamic views on concubinage|sex slaves]]. The trafficking of Armenian women as sex slaves was an important source of income for accompanying soldiers. In Arab areas, enslaved Armenian women were sold at low prices. The German consul at [[Mosul]] reported that the maximum price for an Armenian woman was "5 piastres" (about 20 Pence Sterling at the time).{{sfn|Akçam|2012|p=314-5}}

[[Karen Jeppe]], who was working for the [[League of Nations]] in [[Aleppo]] and was attempting to free the tens of thousands of women and children who had been abducted, said in 1926 that out of the thousands of women she had spoken to, only one had not been sexually abused.{{sfn|Bjørnlund|2011|p=24}}

Rössler, the German consul in Aleppo during the genocide, heard from an "objective" Armenian that around a quarter of young women, whose appearance was "more or less pleasing", were regularly raped by the gendarmes, and that "even more beautiful ones" were violated by 10-15 men. This resulted in girls and women being left behind dying, naked.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gust|first1=Wolfgang|title=The Armenian Genocide: Evidence from the German Foreign Office Archives, 1915-1916|date=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781782381433|pages=26–7}}</ref>

[[Aurora Mardiganian|Aurora (Arshaluys) Mardiganian]], who emigrated to the United States after escaping through Europe, brought the story of mass rapes during the Armenian genocide to public attention through her 1918 memoir ''[[Ravished Armenia]]'', which served as the basis for the 1919 silent film, ''[[Ravished Armenia (film)|Auction of Souls]]''. The [[Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity]] is named in her honor.

== War crimes trials ==

{{main|Effort to prosecute Ottoman war criminals}}

Following the end of World War I, the British exerted pressure on the Sultan to bring to trial the leadership of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) for crimes against humanity. By April 1919 over 100 Turkish officials had been arrested.

Testimony given by Nuri, the police chief of [[Trabzon]], claimed that he had been given young girls, as a gift from the governor-general to the CUP central committee. A merchant by name of Mehmed Ali testified that not only were children being killed at the Red Crescent Hospital, but that young girls were also being raped and that the governor-general held there fifteen girls for his sexual gratification. Hasan Maruf, a military officer, testified to the British that "Government officials at Trebizond picked out some of the prettiest Armenian women of the best families. After committing the worst outrages on them, they had them killed."{{sfn|Dadrian|2008|pp=83–84}}

The court found the lieutenant governor [[Mehmed Kemal Bey]], of the district of [[Yozgat]], guilty of murder and forced relocation; he was sentenced to death by hanging. Major Tevfik Bey, a commander of police was also found guilty and sentenced 15 years in prison with hard labour.{{sfn|DeLaet|2005|pp=162–163}}
