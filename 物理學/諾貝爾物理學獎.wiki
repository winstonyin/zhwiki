'''諾貝爾物理學獎'''（{{lang-sv|Nobelpriset i fysik}}）是[[瑞典皇家科學院]]為表彰在[[物理學]]作出最傑出的貢獻而一年一度頒發的獎項。It is one of the five [[诺贝尔奖|Nobel Prize]]s established by the will of [[阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔|Alfred Nobel]] in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the [[诺贝尔化学奖|Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], [[诺贝尔文学奖|Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[诺贝尔和平奖|Nobel Peace Prize]], and [[诺贝尔生理学或医学奖|Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].

The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to German/Dutch physicist [[威廉·伦琴|Wilhelm Röntgen]] in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays (or [[X射线|x-ray]]s). This award is administered by the [[诺贝尔基金会|Nobel Foundation]] and widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physics. It is presented in [[斯德哥尔摩|Stockholm]] at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Through 2016, a total of 203 individuals have been awarded the prize.<ref name=nobelOrg>{{cite web | title=All Nobel Prizes in Physics| website = Nobelprize.org | publisher = Nobel Media AB |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/| accessdate=2016-01-19}}</ref>

Only two women have won the Nobel Prize in Physics: [[玛丽·居里|Marie Curie]] in 1903, and [[玛丽亚·格佩特-梅耶|Maria Goeppert Mayer]] in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html |title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|date=2 February 2017|website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=''Nobel Media 2017'' |accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>

== Background ==
[[阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔|Alfred Nobel]], in his last will and testament, stated that his wealth be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in the fields of [[物理学|physics]], [[化學|chemistry]], [[和平|peace]], [[生理学|physiology]] or [[医学|medicine]], and [[文學|literature]].<ref name="BBCHistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nobel_alfred.shtml |title=History – Historic Figures: Alfred Nobel (1833–1896) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref> Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last one was written a year before he died and was signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in [[巴黎|Paris]] on 27 November 1895.<ref>[[#Sohlman69|Ragnar Sohlman]]: 1983, Page 7</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://static-content.springer.com/lookinside/art%3A10.1007%2FBF01047469/000.png | title=The Nobel Foundation and its Role for Modern Day Science | publisher=Springer-Verlag | work=Die Naturwissenschaften | date=6 June 1981 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=von Euler| first=U.S. | format=PDF}}</ref> Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31&nbsp;million [[Swedish krona|Swedish ''kronor'']] ([[美元|US]]$198 million, [[欧元|Euro]]€176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/will-full.html | title=Nobel's will | publisher=Nobel.org | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref> Due to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until April 26, 1897 that it was approved by the [[挪威議會|Storting]] (Norwegian Parliament).<ref name="nobelprize1">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html |title=The Nobel Foundation – History |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109140259/http://nobelprize.org/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html |archivedate=January 9, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Levinovitz13">[[#Levinovitz69|Agneta Wallin Levinovitz]]: 2001, Page 13</ref> The executors of his will were {{tsl|en|Ragnar Sohlman||Ragnar Sohlman}} and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes.

The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on June 7, the Swedish Academy on June 9, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on June 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/nobel-prize-history.html |title=Nobel Prize History – |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=1999-10-13 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416852/Nobel-Foundation |title=Nobel Foundation (Scandinavian organisation) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref> The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King [[奧斯卡二世|Oscar II]].<ref name="Levinovitz13" /><ref name=BritannicaWill>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416856/Nobel-Prize "Nobel Prize]" (2007), in ''[[大英百科全书|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', accessed 15 January 2009, from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'': {{quote|After Nobel’s death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize-awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions, which rest exclusively with the four institutions. }}</ref> According to Nobel's will, The Royal Swedish Academy of sciences were to award the Prize in Physics.<ref name=BritannicaWill />

A maximum of three [[諾貝爾獎得主列表|Nobel laureate]]s and two different works may be selected for the Nobel Prize in Physics.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/ | title=Facts and figures | accessdate=May 4, 2015 | author=Nobelprize.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://globaljournals.org/GJSFR_Volume13/3-On-the-Nobel-Prize-in-Physics-Controversies.pdf | title=GJSFR | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref> Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is long and rigorous. This is a key reason why it has grown in importance over the years to become the most important prize in Physics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416856/Nobel-Prize#toc93433 | title=The Nobel Prize Selection Process | publisher=Brittanica Encyclopaedia | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>

The Nobel laureates are selected by the {{tsl|en|Nobel Committee for Physics||Nobel Committee for Physics}}, a [[諾貝爾委員會|Nobel Committee]] that consists of five members elected by [[瑞典皇家科学院|The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In the first stage that begins in September, around 3,000 people – selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, etc. – are sent confidential forms to nominate candidates. The completed nomination forms arrive at the Nobel Committee no later than 31 January of the following year. These nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts who narrow it to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates into the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics through a majority vote.<ref name="Nomination">{{cite web|title=Nomination and Selection of Physics Laureates|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/physics/|website=nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2016|accessdate=6 October 2016}}</ref>

The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years.<ref name="fiftyyearsrule">{{cite web | url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_intro/nomination_secrecy/ | title=50 year secrecy rule | accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can be made if the individual died in the months between the decision of the prize committee (typically in October) and the ceremony in December. Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the recipient had died after being nominated.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/statutes.html#par4 | title=About posthumous awards | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>

The rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been "tested by time". In practice, it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to [[苏布拉马尼扬·钱德拉塞卡|Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this approach, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time the impact of their work is appreciated.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-009-0035-9 |title=Why it has become more difficult to predict Nobel Prize winners: A bibliometric analysis of nominees and winners of the chemistry and physics prizes (1901–2007) |date=2009 |last1=Gingras |first1=Yves |last2=Wallace |first2=Matthew L. |journal=Scientometrics |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=401}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nature Chemistry |doi=10.1038/nchem.372|bibcode = 2009NatCh...1..509.|title=A noble prize|date=2009|volume=1|issue=7|pages=509|pmid=21378920 }}</ref>

=== Medals ===
The Nobel Prize medals, minted by {{tsl|en|Myntverket||Myntverket}}<ref>{{cite web | title = Medalj – ett traditionellt hantverk | publisher = Myntverket | url = http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang=sv&page=3 | language = Swedish | accessdate = 2007-12-15 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071218102934/http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang=sv&amp;page=3 <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 2007-12-18 }}</ref> in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design.<ref name=PaulingPeacePrize>[http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/pawardsmedals&CISOPTR=47 "The Nobel Prize for Peace"], "Linus Pauling: Awards, Honors, and Medals", ''Linus Pauling and The Nature of the Chemical Bond: A Documentary History'', the {{tsl|en|The Valley Library||Valley Library}}, [[俄勒岡州立大學|Oregon State University]].

The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of Nature, as a Goddess, whose veil is held up by the Genius of Science. These medals and the ones for Physiology/Medicine and Literature were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.<ref name="Nobel Prize for Physics and Chemistry">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/medal.html] The Nobel Prize for Physics and Chemistry.</ref>

=== Diplomas ===
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate that receives it.<ref name="nobelprize5">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/diplomas/|title=The Nobel Prize Diplomas |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref> The diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.<ref name="nobelprize5" />

=== Award money ===
The laureate is also given a sum of money when they receive the Nobel Prize in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded; in 2009, the monetary award was 10 million [[瑞典克朗|SEK]] (US$1.4 million).<ref name="nobelprize2" /> Due to budget cuts, in 2012, the amount for each Nobel prize was 8 million SEK, or US$1.1 million.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-11/world/world_europe_nobel-prize-cut_1_nobel-prize-nobel-foundation-alfred-nobel?_s=PM:EUROPE | title=Nobel prize amounts to be cut 20% in 2012 | publisher=CNN | date=2012-06-11 | accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref>  The amount may differ depending on how much money the Nobel Foundation can award that year. If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients. If there are three, the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally, or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/05/nobel-prize-medicine-2009-award|title=Nobel prize for medicine shared by scientists for work on ageing and cancer &#124; Science &#124; guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-10-05|accessdate=2015-05-03 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Sample}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ian Sample, Science correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/07/physics.nobel |title=Three share Nobel prize for physics &#124; Science &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2008-10-07|accessdate=2010-02-10 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/press.html |title=The 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics – Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref>

=== Ceremony ===
The committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates in October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually in {{tsl|en|Stockholm Concert Hall||Stockholm Concert Hall}} on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
