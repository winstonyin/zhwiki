[[File:Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845--1923).jpg|thumb|upright|[[威廉·倫琴]]（1845年–1923年）是諾貝爾物理學獎的首屆得主]]
'''諾貝爾物理學獎'''（{{lang-sv|Nobelpriset i fysik}}）是[[瑞典皇家科學院]]為表彰在[[物理學]]作出最傑出的貢獻，自1901年起一年一度頒發的獎項；獎金由[[諾貝爾基金會]]發出。獎項是[[阿爾弗雷德·諾貝爾]]1895年的遺囑中設立的五個[[諾貝爾獎]]之一，其它四個分別為[[諾貝爾化學獎|化學獎]]、[[諾貝爾文學獎|文學獎]]、[[諾貝爾和平獎|和平獎]]及[[諾貝爾生理學或醫學獎|生理學或醫學獎]]。諾貝爾物理學獎被普遍認為是在物理學領域能夠取得的最高榮譽。

頒獎典禮於每年12月10日，即諾貝爾逝世週年紀念日，在瑞典[[斯德哥爾摩]]舉行。首屆諾貝爾物理學獎由發現[[X射線]]的德國荷蘭物理學家[[威廉·倫琴]]獲得。截至2016年，共有203人得獎，<ref name=nobelOrg>{{cite web | title=All Nobel Prizes in Physics| website = Nobelprize.org | publisher = Nobel Media AB |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/| accessdate=2016-01-19}}</ref>其中女性得主僅有兩位：1903年的[[瑪麗·居里]]和1963年的[[瑪麗亞·格佩特-梅耶]]。<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html |title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|date=2 February 2017|website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=''Nobel Media 2017'' |accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>

== 歷史背景 ==
根據[[阿爾弗雷德·諾貝爾]]的最後遺囑所述，他的遺產將用於建立一系列獎項，表彰在[[物理學]]、[[化學]]、[[和平]]、[[生理學]]或[[醫學]]以及[[文學]]上「對人類作出最大貢獻」的人士。<ref name="BBCHistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nobel_alfred.shtml |title=History – Historic Figures: Alfred Nobel (1833–1896) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref>諾貝爾生前曾寫過幾份遺囑，其中最後一份在他逝世前一年寫成，並於1895年11月27日於[[巴黎]]的瑞典挪威俱樂部簽訂。<ref>[[#Sohlman69|Ragnar Sohlman]]: 1983, Page 7</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://static-content.springer.com/lookinside/art%3A10.1007%2FBF01047469/000.png | title=The Nobel Foundation and its Role for Modern Day Science | publisher=Springer-Verlag | work=Die Naturwissenschaften | date=6 June 1981 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=von Euler| first=U.S. | format=PDF}}</ref>用於設立五個諾貝爾獎的資產佔諾貝爾總資產的94%，即3100萬[[瑞典克朗]]（相等於2016年的1.98億[[美元]]、1.76億[[歐元]]）。<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/will-full.html | title=Nobel's will | publisher=Nobel.org | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>然而，人們當時對這份遺囑將信將疑，所以遺囑一直到1897年4月26日才經[[挪威議會]]通過執行。<ref name="nobelprize1">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html |title=The Nobel Foundation – History |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109140259/http://nobelprize.org/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html |archivedate=January 9, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Levinovitz13">[[#Levinovitz69|Agneta Wallin Levinovitz]]: 2001, Page 13</ref>執行人{{tsl|en|Ragnar Sohlman||Ragnar Sohlman}}和Rudolf Lilljequist設立了諾貝爾基金會，管理遺產和獎金。

遺囑通過後不久，議會便委任了負責頒發獎項的諾貝爾和平獎委員會。The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on June 7, the Swedish Academy on June 9, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on June 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/nobel-prize-history.html |title=Nobel Prize History – |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=1999-10-13 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416852/Nobel-Foundation |title=Nobel Foundation (Scandinavian organisation) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref> The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King [[奧斯卡二世|Oscar II]].<ref name="Levinovitz13" /><ref name=BritannicaWill>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416856/Nobel-Prize "Nobel Prize]" (2007), in ''[[大英百科全书|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', accessed 15 January 2009, from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'': {{quote|After Nobel’s death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds. In his will, he had stipulated that four different institutions—three Swedish and one Norwegian—should award the prizes. From Stockholm, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for physics, chemistry, and economics, the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for physiology or medicine, and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize-awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions, which rest exclusively with the four institutions. }}</ref>根據諾貝爾的遺囑，物理學獎須由瑞典皇家科學院頒發。<ref name=BritannicaWill />

The Nobel laureates are selected by the {{tsl|en|Nobel Committee for Physics||Nobel Committee for Physics}}, a [[諾貝爾委員會|Nobel Committee]] that consists of five members elected by [[瑞典皇家科学院|The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In the first stage that begins in September, around 3,000 people – selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, etc. – are sent confidential forms to nominate candidates. The completed nomination forms arrive at the Nobel Committee no later than 31 January of the following year. These nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts who narrow it to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates into the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics through a majority vote.<ref name="Nomination">{{cite web|title=Nomination and Selection of Physics Laureates|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/physics/|website=nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2016|accessdate=6 October 2016}}</ref>

The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years.<ref name="fiftyyearsrule">{{cite web | url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_intro/nomination_secrecy/ | title=50 year secrecy rule | accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can be made if the individual died in the months between the decision of the prize committee (typically in October) and the ceremony in December. Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the recipient had died after being nominated.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/statutes.html#par4 | title=About posthumous awards | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>

The rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been "tested by time". In practice, it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to [[苏布拉马尼扬·钱德拉塞卡|Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this approach, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time the impact of their work is appreciated.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-009-0035-9 |title=Why it has become more difficult to predict Nobel Prize winners: A bibliometric analysis of nominees and winners of the chemistry and physics prizes (1901–2007) |date=2009 |last1=Gingras |first1=Yves |last2=Wallace |first2=Matthew L. |journal=Scientometrics |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=401}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nature Chemistry |doi=10.1038/nchem.372|bibcode = 2009NatCh...1..509.|title=A noble prize|date=2009|volume=1|issue=7|pages=509|pmid=21378920 }}</ref>

=== Medals ===
The Nobel Prize medals, minted by {{tsl|en|Myntverket||Myntverket}}<ref>{{cite web | title = Medalj – ett traditionellt hantverk | publisher = Myntverket | url = http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang=sv&page=3 | language = Swedish | accessdate = 2007-12-15 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071218102934/http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang=sv&amp;page=3 <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 2007-12-18 }}</ref> in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design.<ref name=PaulingPeacePrize>[http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/pawardsmedals&CISOPTR=47 "The Nobel Prize for Peace"], "Linus Pauling: Awards, Honors, and Medals", ''Linus Pauling and The Nature of the Chemical Bond: A Documentary History'', the {{tsl|en|The Valley Library||Valley Library}}, [[俄勒岡州立大學|Oregon State University]].

The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of Nature, as a Goddess, whose veil is held up by the Genius of Science. These medals and the ones for Physiology/Medicine and Literature were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.<ref name="Nobel Prize for Physics and Chemistry">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/medal.html] The Nobel Prize for Physics and Chemistry.</ref>

=== Diplomas ===
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate that receives it.<ref name="nobelprize5">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/diplomas/|title=The Nobel Prize Diplomas |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref> The diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.<ref name="nobelprize5" />

=== Award money ===
The laureate is also given a sum of money when they receive the Nobel Prize in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded; in 2009, the monetary award was 10 million [[瑞典克朗|SEK]] (US$1.4 million).<ref name="nobelprize2" /> Due to budget cuts, in 2012, the amount for each Nobel prize was 8 million SEK, or US$1.1 million.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-11/world/world_europe_nobel-prize-cut_1_nobel-prize-nobel-foundation-alfred-nobel?_s=PM:EUROPE | title=Nobel prize amounts to be cut 20% in 2012 | publisher=CNN | date=2012-06-11 | accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref>  The amount may differ depending on how much money the Nobel Foundation can award that year. If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients. If there are three, the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally, or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/05/nobel-prize-medicine-2009-award|title=Nobel prize for medicine shared by scientists for work on ageing and cancer &#124; Science &#124; guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-10-05|accessdate=2015-05-03 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Sample}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ian Sample, Science correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/07/physics.nobel |title=Three share Nobel prize for physics &#124; Science &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2008-10-07|accessdate=2010-02-10 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/press.html |title=The 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics – Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref>

=== Ceremony ===
The committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates in October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually in {{tsl|en|Stockholm Concert Hall||Stockholm Concert Hall}} on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.  The laureates receive a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount.<ref name="awardceremony">{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/ceremonies/archive/history/index.html | title=Nobel prize award ceremony | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>
