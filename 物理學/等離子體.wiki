'''等離子-{}-體'''（又稱'''電-{}-漿'''）是在[[固態]]、[[液態]]和[[氣態]]以外的第四大[[物質狀態]]，其特性與前三者截然不同。

氣體在高溫或強[[電磁場]]下，會變為等離子體。在這種狀態下，氣體中的原子會擁有比正常更多或更少的[[電子]]，從而形成陰離子或陽離子，即帶負電荷或正電荷的粒子。<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Luo |first1=Q-Z|last2=D'Angelo|first2=N|last3=Merlino|first3=R.

由於等離子體含有許多[[載流子]]，因此它能夠[[導電]]，對電磁場也有很強的反應。和氣體一樣，等離子體的形狀和體積並非固定，而是會根據容器而改變；但和氣體不一樣的是，在磁場的作用下，它會形成各種結構，例如絲狀物、圓柱狀物和[[雙層 (等離子體)|雙層]]等。

等離子體是宇宙[[重子]]物質最常見的形態，其中大部分存在於稀薄的[[外層空間|星系際空間]]（特別是[[星系團內介質]]）和[[恆星]]之中。<ref>{{Cite web | title = Ionization and Plasmas | publisher = The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Department of Physics and Astronomy | url = http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/ionization.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title = How Lightning Works | publisher = HowStuffWorks| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/natural-disasters/lightning2.htm}}</ref>

人類對等離子體的了解大部分來自於[[聚變能]]研究，等離子體物理也從中發展起來。

==性質==

===定義===
等離子體是由未結合離子所組成的電中性物質，其中陰離子和陽離子的總電荷月等於零。雖然這些離子不相互結合，但這並不意味著它們不受到力的影響：等離子體中的每顆帶電粒子都受到其他粒子移動時產生的電磁場的影響。<ref name="Sturrock">{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics: An Introduction to the Theory of Astrophysical, Geophysical & Laboratory Plasmas |last=Sturrock |first=Peter A. |date=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44810-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Framework of Plasma Physics |author=Hazeltine, R.D. |author2=Waelbroeck, F.L. |date=2004 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-7382-0047-7}}
</ref>等離子體的定義有三個重要部分：<ref name="Hazeltine">{{cite book|author=Dendy, R. O. |title=Plasma Dynamics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S1C6-4OBOeYC|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1990|isbn=978-0-19-852041-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Hastings, Daniel|author2=Garrett, Henry|last-author-amp=yes |title=Spacecraft-Environment Interactions|isbn=978-0-521-47128-2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000}}</ref>

#'''等離子體近似'''：帶電粒子之間的距離必須足夠接近，使得每顆粒子都能夠影響許多鄰近的粒子，而不是只影響最接近的粒子，從而產生集體性效應。只有當每顆帶電粒子的影響範圍內都有平均超過一顆帶電粒子，等離子體近似才是有效的。這一影響範圍稱為德拜球，是一個半徑為[[德拜長度]]的球體空間。德拜球內的粒子數量稱為[[等離子參數]]，由希臘字母Λ表示。
#'''體積相互作用'''：相對等離子體的整體大小來說，德拜長度必須很短。這意味著相互作用主要在等離子體的體積內部，而不是它的邊緣上。若符合這個準則，則等離子體可視為準中性。
#'''等離子體頻率'''：電子和電子之間的碰撞頻率必須比電子和中性粒子之間的碰撞頻率高得多。若滿足此條件，則靜電效應會比普通氣體動力學效應強得多。

===參數的範圍===
電漿的參數可以在數個[[數量級]]之間變化，但在參數上顯然不同的電漿，卻有相當類似的性質（參考{{link-en|電漿比例|plasma scaling}}），下表只考慮傳統帶正負電的電漿，不考慮特殊的[[夸克-膠子漿]]。
等離子體的各種參數可以有跨越幾個數量級的數值範圍。不過，有的等離子體雖然在參數上顯然不同，但性質卻十分相似。以下只考慮普通的原子等離子體，不考慮[[夸克-膠子漿]]這類奇異現象。

===電離度===
[[電離]]是等離子體存在的必要條件。「等離子體密度」通常指的是「電子密度」，也就是每單位體積中的自由電子數量。[[電離度]]指的是等離子體中電子數比正常更多或更少的原子所佔的比例，這主要受溫度影響。就算氣體粒子中只有1%是電離粒子，這一氣體也會表現出等離子體的一些特性，例如會受磁場影響、能夠導電等等。電離度<math>\alpha</math>的明確定義是<math>\alpha = \frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n}</math>，其中<math>n_i</math>是離子的數量密度（每單位體積中的數量），而<math>n_n</math>是中性原子的數量密度。電子密度<math>n_e</math>與電離度的關係是<math>n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i</math>，其中<math>\langle Z\rangle</math>是離子的平均電荷態。

===溫度===
<!--{{see also|Nonthermal plasma|Anisothermal plasma}}-->
等離子體的溫度籠統地來說代表了每顆粒子的平均動能，一般用[[開爾文]]或[[電子伏特]]來量度。要維持等離子體的電離狀態，一般需要較高的溫度。[[薩哈電離方程]]說明，[[電子溫度]]與[[電離能]]之比決定了等離子體的電離度（密度也有較弱的影響）。在低溫下，離子和電子會互相結合，形成結合態，即原子，<ref name="Nicholson">{{cite book |title=Introduction to Plasma Theory |last=Nicholson |first= Dwight R. |date=1983 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-09045-8}}</ref>等離子態也會因此最終變為氣體。

在大多數情況下，等離子體中的電子很接近[[熱平衡]]，所以電子溫度有良好的定義。在[[紫外線]]、高能粒子或強[[電場]]等的影響下，電子的能量分佈和[[麥克斯韋-波茲曼分佈]]會有較大的偏離，但儘管如此，電子溫度仍然具有良好定義。由於質量相差懸殊，所以電子和電子之間比電子和離子或中性原子之間更快地達致熱平衡。因此，離子溫度和電子溫度可以有巨大的差異（通常前者更低）。這種情況在弱電離等離子體中尤為常見，其中的離子一般接近[[室溫]]。

====高溫與低溫等離子體====
等離子體可以根據其電子、離子和中性粒子的相對溫度歸為兩類──高溫等離子體和低溫等離子體。在高溫等離子體中，電子、離子和中性粒子處於同一溫度，即熱平衡；在低溫等離子體中，電子有較高的溫度，而離子和中性粒子的溫度則比電子低很多，有時甚至接近室溫。<ref>von Engel, A. and Cozens, J.R. (1976) "Flame Plasma" in ''Advances in electronics and electron physics'', L. L. Marton (ed.), Academic Press, ISBN 978-0-12-014520-1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&lpg=PA99 p. 99]</ref>

====完全與非完全電離====
等離子體可以根據電離程度分為冷、熱兩種。熱等離子體中的粒子幾乎完全電離，而冷等離子體中則只有小部分電離粒子（比如1%）。「冷」、「熱」等離子體在不同文獻中可能會有不同的含義。就算是在所謂的「冷」等離子體中，電子溫度也可以達到幾千攝氏度。

===等離子體電勢===
[[File:Bliksem in Assen.jpg|thumb|[[閃電]]是地球表面常見的等離子體現象。每次閃電一般在1億[[伏特]]電壓下釋放出30,000[[安培]]，同時放出[[可見光]]、[[無線電波]]、[[X光]]乃至[[伽馬射線]]。<ref>參見：[http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning]</ref>閃電中的等離子體溫度可達到28000&nbsp;K，電子密度可超過<nowrap>10<sup>24</sup> m<sup>−3</sup></nowrap>。]]

Since plasmas are very good [[electrical conductor]]s, electric potentials play an important role.
The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the "plasma potential", or the "space potential". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of "quasineutrality", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (<math>n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i</math>), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:
:<math>n_e \propto e^{e\Phi/k_BT_e}.</math>

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:
:<math>\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\nabla n_e/n_e).</math>

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].

In [[astrophysical]] plasmas, [[electric field screening|Debye screening]] prevents [[electric field]]s from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the [[Debye length]]. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated [[magnetic field]]s are studied in the [[academic discipline]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

===Magnetization===
Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., <math>\omega_{\mathrm{ce}} / v_{\mathrm{coll}} > 1</math>, where <math>\omega_{\mathrm{ce}}</math> is the "electron gyrofrequency" and <math>v_{\mathrm{coll}}</math> is the "electron collision rate". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are ''[[anisotropic]]'', meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by <math>\mathbf{E} = -v\times\mathbf{B}</math> (where <math>\mathbf{E}</math> is the electric field, <math>\mathbf{v}</math> is the velocity, and <math>\mathbf{B}</math> is the magnetic field), and is not affected by [[Debye shielding]].<ref>Richard Fitzpatrick, ''Introduction to Plasma Physics'', [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html Magnetized plasmas]</ref>

===Comparison of plasma and gas phases===
Plasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases, despite plasma typically being an ionized gas.<ref>Yaffa Eliezer, Shalom Eliezer, ''The Fourth State of Matter: An Introduction to the Physics of Plasma'', Publisher: Adam Hilger, 1989, ISBN 978-0-85274-164-1, 226 pages, page 5</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bittencourt, J.A.|title=Fundamentals of Plasma Physics|publisher=Springer|date=2004|isbn=9780387209753|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCA64ys-5bUC&pg=PA1}}</ref> It is distinct from these and other lower-energy [[states of matter]]. Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Property !! Gas !! Plasma
|-
! [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|Electrical conductivity]]
| '''Very low''': Air is an excellent insulator until it breaks down into plasma at electric field strengths above 30 kilovolts per centimeter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/AliceHong.shtml|title=Dielectric Strength of Air|date=2000|first=Alice|last=Hong|work=The Physics Factbook}}</ref>
| '''Usually very high''': For many purposes, the conductivity of a plasma may be treated as infinite.
|-
! Independently acting species
| '''One''': All gas particles behave in a similar way, influenced by [[gravity]] and by [[collision]]s with one another.
| '''Two or three''': [[Electron]]s, [[ion]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can be distinguished by the sign and value of their [[electric charge|charge]] so that they behave independently in many circumstances, with different bulk velocities and temperatures, allowing phenomena such as new types of [[waves in plasma|waves]] and [[Instability|instabilities]].
|-
! Velocity distribution
| '''[[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]''': Collisions usually lead to a Maxwellian velocity distribution of all gas particles, with very few relatively fast particles.
| '''Often non-Maxwellian''': Collisional interactions are often weak in hot plasmas and external forcing can drive the plasma far from local equilibrium and lead to a significant population of unusually fast particles.
|-
! Interactions
| '''Binary''': Two-particle collisions are the rule, three-body collisions extremely rare.
| '''Collective''': Waves, or organized motion of plasma, are very important because the particles can interact at long ranges through the electric and magnetic forces.

==Common plasmas==
[[File:Plasma Cutter.jpg|thumb|A handheld [[Plasma cutting|plasma cutter]] used to cut steel plates. A jet of gas is heated with an [[electric arc]] into a plasma.]]
{{further information|Astrophysical plasma|Interstellar medium|Intergalactic space}}
Plasmas are by far the most common [[Phase (matter)|phase of ordinary matter]] in the universe, both by mass and by volume.<ref>It is often stated that more than 99% of the material in the visible universe is plasma. See, for example, {{cite book|author=Gurnett, D. A.|author2=Bhattacharjee, A.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Introduction to Plasma Physics: With Space and Laboratory Applications|date=2005|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VcueZlunrbcC&pg=PA2|page=2|isbn=978-0-521-36483-6|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}} and {{cite book|author=Scherer, K|author2=Fichtner, H|author3=Heber, B|last-author-amp=yes |title=Space Weather: The Physics Behind a Slogan|date=2005|url=https://books.google.com/?id=irHgIUtLi0gC&pg=PA138|page=138|isbn=978-3-540-22907-0|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin}}.</ref> Essentially, all of the visible light from space comes from stars, which are plasmas with a temperature such that they radiate strongly at visible wavelengths. Most of the ordinary (or [[baryon]]ic) matter in the universe, however, is found in the [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|intergalactic medium]], which is also a plasma, but much hotter, so that it radiates primarily as X-rays.

In 1937, [[Hannes Alfvén]] argued that if plasma pervaded the universe, it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic magnetic field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = Hannes | date = 1937 | title = Cosmic Radiation as an Intra-galactic Phenomenon | url = | journal = Arkiv för Matematik, Astronomi och Fysik | volume = 25B | issue = | page = 29 }}</ref> After winning the Nobel Prize, he emphasized that: <blockquote>In order to understand the phenomena in a certain plasma region, it is necessary to map not only the magnetic but also the electric field and the electric currents. Space is filled with a network of currents which transfer energy and momentum over large or very large distances. The currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents. The latter are likely to give space, as also interstellar and intergalactic space, a cellular structure.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Hannes | first = A | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1990ITPS...18....5A&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c32555 | title = Cosmology in the Plasma Universe: An Introductory Exposition | date =1990 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | issn =  0093-3813 | volume = 18  | pages = 5–10|bibcode = 1990ITPS...18....5P |doi = 10.1109/27.45495 }}</ref></blockquote>

By contrast the current scientific consensus is that about 96% of the total energy density in the universe is not plasma or any other form of ordinary matter, but a combination of [[cold dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. Our Sun, and all of the other [[star]]s, are made of plasma, much of [[Interstellar medium|interstellar space]] is filled with a plasma, albeit a very sparse one, and [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|intergalactic space]] too. Even [[black holes]], which are not directly visible, are thought to be fuelled by accreting ionising matter (i.e. plasma),<ref>Mészáros, Péter (2010) ''The High Energy Universe: Ultra-High Energy Events in Astrophysics and Cosmology'', Publisher    Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-51700-3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NXvE_zQX5kAC&lpg=PA99&dq=%22Black%20hole%22%20plasma%20acreting&pg=PA99 p. 99].</ref> and they are associated with [[astrophysical jets]] of luminous ejected plasma,<ref>Raine, Derek J. and Thomas, Edwin George (2010) ''Black Holes: An Introduction'', Publisher: Imperial College Press, ISBN 978-1-84816-382-9, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O3puAMw5U3UC&lpg=PA160 p. 160]</ref> such as [[Messier 87#Jet|M87's jet]] that extends 5,000 light-years.<ref>Nemiroff, Robert and Bonnell, Jerry (11 December 2004) [http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041211.html Astronomy Picture of the Day], nasa.gov</ref>

In our solar system, [[interplanetary space]] is filled with the plasma of the [[Solar Wind]] that extends from the Sun out to the [[Heliopause (astronomy)#Heliopause|heliopause]].  However, the density of ordinary matter is much higher than average and much higher than that of either dark matter or dark energy. The planet [[Jupiter]] accounts for most of the ''non''-plasma within the orbit of [[Pluto]] (about 0.1% by mass, or 10<sup>−15</sup>% by volume).

Dust and small grains within a plasma will also pick up a net negative charge, so that they in turn may act like a very heavy negative ion component of the plasma (see [[dusty plasma]]s).

==Complex plasma phenomena==

Although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behavior is extraordinarily varied and subtle: the emergence of unexpected behavior from a simple model is a typical feature of a [[complex system]]. Such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behavior and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a [[fractal]] form. Many of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe. Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include:

===Filamentation===

Filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse. At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] to kilometers in length.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chin, S. L. |url=http://icpr.snu.ac.kr/resource/wop.pdf/J01/2006/049/S01/J012006049S010281.pdf|journal=Journal of the Korean Physical Society|volume=49|date=2006|page=281|title=Some Fundamental Concepts of Femtosecond Laser Filamentation}}</ref> One interesting aspect of the filamentation generated plasma is the relatively low ion density due to defocusing effects of the ionized electrons.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Talebpour | first1 = A. | last2 = Abdel-Fattah | first2 = M. | last3 = Chin | first3 = S.

===Shocks or double layers===
Plasma properties change rapidly (within a few [[Debye length]]s) across a two-dimensional sheet in the presence of a (moving) shock or (stationary) [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]. Double layers involve localized charge separation, which causes a large potential difference across the layer, but does not generate an electric field outside the layer. Double layers separate adjacent plasma regions with different physical characteristics, and are often found in current carrying plasmas. They accelerate both ions and electrons.

===Electric fields and circuits===
Quasineutrality of a plasma requires that plasma currents close on themselves in electric circuits. Such circuits follow [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] and possess a [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[inductance]]. These circuits must generally be treated as a strongly coupled system, with the behavior in each plasma region dependent on the entire circuit. It is this strong coupling between system elements, together with nonlinearity, which may lead to complex behavior. Electrical circuits in plasmas store inductive (magnetic) energy, and should the circuit be disrupted, for example, by a plasma instability, the inductive energy will be released as plasma heating and acceleration. This is a common explanation for the heating that takes place in the [[solar corona]]. Electric currents, and in particular, magnetic-field-aligned electric currents (which are sometimes generically referred to as "[[Birkeland current]]s"), are also observed in the Earth's aurora, and in plasma filaments.

===Cellular structure===
Narrow sheets with sharp gradients may separate regions with different properties such as magnetization, density and temperature, resulting in cell-like regions. Examples include the [[magnetosphere]], [[heliosphere]], and [[heliospheric current sheet]]. [[Hannes Alfvén]] wrote: "From the cosmological point of view, the most important new space research discovery is probably the cellular structure of space. As has been seen in every region of space accessible to in situ measurements, there are a number of 'cell walls', sheets of electric currents, which divide space into compartments with different magnetization, temperature, density, etc."<ref>{{cite book|author=Alfvén, Hannes |title=Cosmic Plasma|date=1981|chapter=section VI.13.1. Cellular Structure of Space|isbn=978-90-277-1151-9|publisher=Dordrecht}}</ref>

===Critical ionization velocity===
The [[critical ionization velocity]] is the relative velocity between an ionized plasma and a neutral gas, above which a runaway ionization process takes place. The critical ionization process is a quite general mechanism for the conversion of the kinetic energy of a rapidly streaming gas into ionization and plasma thermal energy. Critical phenomena in general are typical of complex systems, and may lead to sharp spatial or temporal features.

===Ultracold plasma===
Ultracold plasmas are created in a [[magneto-optical trap]] (MOT) by trapping and cooling neutral [[atoms]], to temperatures of 1&nbsp;[[millikelvin|mK]] or lower, and then using another [[laser]] to [[ionize]] the atoms by giving each of the outermost electrons just enough energy to escape the electrical attraction of its parent ion.

One advantage of ultracold plasmas are their well characterized and tunable initial conditions, including their size and electron temperature. By adjusting the wavelength of the ionizing laser, the kinetic energy of the liberated electrons can be tuned as low as 0.1 K, a limit set by the frequency bandwidth of the laser pulse. The ions inherit the millikelvin temperatures of the neutral atoms, but are quickly heated through a process known as disorder induced heating (DIH). This type of non-equilibrium ultracold plasma evolves rapidly, and displays many other interesting phenomena.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rHo6IbakG2kC&pg=PA190|pages=190–193|title=Plasma science: advancing knowledge in the national interest|author=National Research Council (U.S.). Plasma 2010 Committee|publisher=National Academies Press|date=2007|isbn=978-0-309-10943-7}}</ref>

One of the metastable states of a strongly nonideal plasma is [[Rydberg matter]], which forms upon condensation of excited atoms.

===Non-neutral plasma===
The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a [[Non-neutral plasmas|non-neutral plasma]]. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged [[particle beam]]s, an electron cloud in a [[Penning trap]] and positron plasmas.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Greaves | first1 = R. G. | last2 = Tinkle | first2 = M.

===Dusty plasma/grain plasma===
A [[dusty plasma]] contains tiny charged particles of dust (typically found in space). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is called  grain plasma. Under laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called ''complex plasmas''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morfill |first=G. E. |title= Complex plasmas: An interdisciplinary research field |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=81 |date=2009 |pages=1353–1404 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.1353|bibcode = 2009RvMP...81.1353M |first2=Alexei V. |last2=Ivlev |issue=4 }}</ref>

===Impermeable plasma===
Impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by [[Hannes Alfvén]] in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] plasma from the reactor walls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alfvén |first1=H. |last2=Smårs |first2=E.|title= Gas-Insulation of a Hot Plasma |journal=Nature |volume=188 |date=1960 |pages=801–802 |doi=10.1038/188801a0|bibcode = 1960Natur.188..801A |issue=4753 }}</ref> However, later it was found that the external [[magnetic fields]] in this configuration could induce [[kink instabilities]] in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Braams |first1=C.M. |title= Stability of Plasma Confined by a Cold-Gas Blanket |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=17 |issue=9 |date=1966 |pages=470–471 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.470|bibcode = 1966PhRvL..17..470B }}</ref>
In 2013, a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no [[magnetic confinement]] using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of different [[nanostructures]] clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of [[ions]] at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex [[nanomaterials]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yaghoubi |first1=A. |last2=Mélinon |first2=P.|title= Tunable synthesis and in situ growth of silicon-carbon mesostructures using impermeable plasma |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |pages=1083 |date=2013 |doi=10.1038/srep01083|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1083Y |pmid=23330064 |pmc=3547321}}</ref>

==Mathematical descriptions==
[[File:Magnetic rope.svg|thumb|The complex self-constricting magnetic field lines and current paths in a field-aligned [[Birkeland current]] that can develop in a plasma.<ref>See [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-345/ch15.htm#250 Evolution of the Solar System]'', 1976''</ref>]]
{{main article|Plasma modeling}}
To completely describe the state of a plasma, we would need to write down all the
particle locations and velocities and describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region.
However, it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma.
Therefore, plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which
there are two main types:

===Fluid model===
Fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see [[Plasma parameters]]). One simple fluid model, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. A more general description is the [[two-fluid plasma]] picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s, nor resolve wave-particle effects.

===Kinetic model===
Kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The [[Vlasov equation]] may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.
In magnetized plasmas, a [[gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic]] approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.

==Artificial plasmas==
Most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:
*The type of power source used to generate the plasma—DC, RF and microwave
*The pressure they operate at—vacuum pressure (< 10&nbsp;mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (~ 1&nbsp;Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760&nbsp;Torr or 100 kPa)
*The degree of ionization within the plasma—fully, partially, or weakly ionized
*The temperature relationships within the plasma—thermal plasma (<math>T_e = T_i = T_{gas}</math>), non-thermal or "cold" plasma (<math>T_e \gg T_i = T_{gas}</math>)
*The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma
*The magnetization of the particles within the plasma—magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in [[Gyroradius|Larmor orbits]] by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate [[Lorentz force]]s)

===Generation of artificial plasma===
[[File:Simple representation of a discharge tube - plasma.png|thumb]]
[[File:Plasma jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Artificial plasma produced in air by a Jacob's Ladder|Artificial plasma produced in air by a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]]]]
Just like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.<ref name="Hippler" /> For this case, plasma is generated when an [[electric current]] is applied across a [[dielectric gas]] or fluid (an electrically [[Electrical conductor|non-conducting]] material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a [[discharge tube]] as a simple example ([[direct current|DC]] used for simplicity).

The [[potential difference]] and subsequent [[electric field]] pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the [[anode]] (positive electrode) while the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.<ref name="Chen">{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion |last=Chen |first=Francis F. |date=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-41332-2}}</ref> As the [[voltage]] increases, the current stresses the material (by [[electric polarization]]) beyond its [[dielectric strength|dielectric limit]] (termed strength) into a stage of [[electrical breakdown]], marked by an [[electric spark]], where the material transforms from being an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] into a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (as it becomes increasingly [[ionized]]). The underlying process is the [[Townsend avalanche]], where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only "after about 20 successive sets of collisions",<ref name="Leal-Quiros" /> mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions).

====Electric arc====
[[File:Cascade-process-of-ionization.svg|thumb|Cascade process of ionization. Electrons are ‘e−’, neutral atoms ‘o’, and cations ‘+’.|left]]
[[File:Townsend Discharge.svg|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionisation event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionising electron and the liberated electron.]]
With ample current density and ionization, this forms a luminous [[electric arc]] (a continuous electric discharge similar to [[lightning]]) between the electrodes.{{#tag:ref|The material undergoes various ‘regimes’ or stages (e.g. saturation, breakdown, glow, transition and thermal arc) as the voltage is increased under the voltage-current relationship. The voltage rises to its maximum value in the saturation stage, and thereafter it undergoes fluctuations of the various stages; while the current progressively increases throughout.<ref name="Leal-Quiros">{{cite journal |author=Leal-Quirós, Edbertho |date=2004 |title=Plasma Processing of Municipal Solid Waste |journal= Brazilian Journal of Physics |volume=34 |issue=4B |pages=1587–1593 |bibcode = 2004BrJPh..34.1587L |doi=10.1590/S0103-97332004000800015}}</ref>|group="Note"}} [[Electrical resistance]] along the continuous electric arc creates [[heat]], which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization is determined by temperature), and as per the sequence: [[solid]]-[[liquid]]-[[gas]]-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma.{{#tag:ref|Across literature, there appears to be no strict definition on where the boundary is between a gas and plasma. Nevertheless, it is enough to say that at 2,000°C the gas molecules become atomized, and ionized at 3,000 °C and "in this state, [the] gas has a liquid like viscosity at atmospheric pressure and the free electric charges confer relatively high electrical conductivities that can approach those of metals."<ref name="Gomez" />|group="Note"}} A thermal plasma is in [[thermal equilibrium]], which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, [[electrical energy]] is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by [[elastic collision]] (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.<ref name="Gomez" /><ref group="Note">Note that non-thermal, or non-equilibrium plasmas are not as ionized and have lower energy densities, and thus the temperature is not dispersed evenly among the particles, where some heavy ones remain ‘cold’.</ref>

==History==
Plasma was first identified in a [[Crookes tube]], and so described by [[Sir William Crookes]] in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter").<ref>Crookes presented a [[lecture]] to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], in Sheffield, on Friday, 22 August 1879 [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html] [http://www.tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm]</ref> The nature of the Crookes tube "[[cathode ray]]" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist [[J. J. Thomson|Sir J.J. Thomson]] in 1897.<ref>Announced in his evening lecture to the [[Royal Institution]] on Friday, 30 April 1897, and published in {{cite journal|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|volume=44|issue=269|pages=293–316|title=J.

<blockquote>Except near the electrodes, where there are ''sheaths'' containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name ''plasma'' to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons.<ref name="langmuir1928" /></blockquote>

Plasmas are the object of study of the [[academic field]] of ''plasma science'' or ''plasma physics'', including sub-disciplines such as [[space plasma physics]].
There are multiple [[academic journals|journals]] devoted to the subject (see [[:Category:Plasma science journals|list]]).
It involves the following fields of active research (see also [[list of plasma (physics) articles|list of articles]]):{{#tag:ref|A more complete and organized list can be found on web sites on plasma science and technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plasmas.com/topics.htm |title=Plasma science and technology|work=plasmas.com}}</ref>|group="Note"}}
