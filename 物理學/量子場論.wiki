'''量子場論'''（{{lang-en|'''Quantum field theory'''}}，簡稱'''QFT'''）是為[[粒子物理]]中的各種[[亞原子粒子]]和[[凝聚態物理學]]中的各種[[準粒子]]建立[[量子力學]]模型的一個[[理論物理|理論]]框架，是結合了[[場 (物理)|經典場論]]、[[狹義相對論]]和量子力學的一套概念和數學工具。<ref>{{harvnb|Peskin|Scroeder|1995|loc=Preface.}}</ref><!--When combined with the [[Cluster decomposition theorem|cluster decomposition principle]],<ref>It is related with, but not identical to the notion of [[causality]]. It says in effect, distant experiments yield uncorrelated results.</ref> it may be the ''only'' way to do so,<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|1995|loc=Preface.}}</ref> while retaining the ideas of [[Point particle|quantum point particle]]s and [[Principle of locality|locality]].-->科學家曾經認為量子場論是描述宇宙的真正根本的理論，但一直以來，把[[廣義相對論]]量子化的嘗試困難重重，所以人們現在相信量子場論只是某個更基礎的未知理論的[[有效場論]]。

量子場論將粒子視為更基礎的[[場 (物理)|場]]上的[[激發態]]，即所謂的[[量子]]，而粒子之間的交互作用則是以相應的場之間的交互項來描述。每個交互作用都可以用[[費曼圖]]來表示，這些圖不但是一種直觀視化的方法，而且還是相對論性協變[[微擾理論 (量子力學)|微擾理論]]中用於計算粒子交互過程的一個重要的數學工具。

==歷史==
<!--{{Main|History of quantum field theory}}-->
儘管量子場論是[[量子力學]]和[[狹義相對論]]相結合的必然結果（{{harvtxt|Weinberg|1995}}），其歷史卻源自1920年代對[[電磁場]]的量子化。

===早期發展===
[[File:Max Born.jpg|220px|thumb|left|[[馬克斯·玻恩]]（1882至1970年），量子場論開拓者之一。他所定下的[[玻恩定則]]首次把量子力學視為以概率為根本的理論。1954年與[[瓦爾特·博特]]同獲[[諾貝爾物理學獎]]。]]
[[量子電動力學]]是量子場論的首個成果，被稱為「成功的量子場理論中之典範」（{{harvtxt|Weinberg|1995}}）。[[光子]]是相對論性粒子的最佳例子：其[[靜質量]]為零，因此在真空中以[[光速]]''c''行進。普通量子力學不是一個相對論性理論，所以無法以近似的方法解釋光子。在光被吸收或發射的各種過程中，例如當[[電子]]在不同[[能級]]之間躍遷時，只能額外假定光子的存在。要明確描述光子，必須用到量子場論。事實上，在量子理論發展的早期（所謂的[[舊量子論]]，1900至1925年），大部分課題都圍繞著光和物質的相互作用，所以都理應以量子場論方法來處理。不過，1926至1927年間由[[保羅·狄拉克]]、[[維爾納·海森堡]]和[[埃爾溫·薛定諤]]所創的量子力學以原子[[光譜學|光譜]]為主要對象，而非光輻射。

在量子力學的概念框架建立完成之際，一小組理論家試圖把量子力學方法應用到[[電磁場]]上。（例如{{harvtxt|Born|Jordan|Heisenberg|1926}}，其中[[帕斯庫爾·約當]]對有關光的量子的文獻尤其熟悉，對量子場論做過開創性的貢獻。）想法大體是，量子場論中的電磁場應以[[矩陣]]來表示，就如量子力學中的位置和動量都以矩陣來表示一樣（[[矩陣力學]]中的諧振子算子）。如此，量子力學的概念被套用到含無限[[自由度 (物理學)|自由度]]的系統上──一組無限個[[量子諧振子]]。

量子場論之始，一般追溯至1927年狄拉克的論文《描述輻射的發射和吸收的量子理論》。<ref>{{harvnb|Dirac|1927}}</ref>論文中，狄拉克首用「量子電動力學」一詞（{{lang-en|Quantum electrodynamics}}，簡稱QED）。他建立了系統性的步驟，把量子理論中粒子的物理量具有不連續性的這一特徵，轉移到場上。他利用量子諧振子理論，為光子從電磁場中出現的現象提供了理論解釋。之後，其他場的量子化步驟，也用到了狄拉克的方法。其後的三年內，這些早期量子場論方法繼續發展。約當建立了對應於遵守[[費米-狄拉克統計]]的場的[[創生及消滅算符]]。和對應於[[玻色–愛因斯坦統計]]的算符不同的是，前者滿足反對易關係，而後者滿足[[對易關係]]。

量子場論方法可以用來推導基於場的量子力學方程式，包括[[狄拉克方程式]]、[[克莱恩-戈登方程式]]和[[麥克斯韋方程式]]。有學者指出，<ref>{{harvnb|Schweber|1994|p=28}}</ref>[[二次量子化]]的概念和步驟可追溯至約當在1927年發表的幾篇論文<ref>詳見{{harvtxt|Schweber|1994|pp=695ff}}中的參考</ref>，但這一術語則是由狄拉克所創。一些圍繞對易關係、統計和[[勞侖茲協變性]]的難題，也都一一陸續得到解決。海森堡和[[華夫岡·鮑利]]在1929至1930年首次全面描述量子場理論中的正則量子化方法。<ref>Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, "Zur Quantendynamik der Wellenfelder", ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', '''56''', 1929, 1–61.</ref><ref>Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, "Zur Quantendynamik der Wellenfelder II", ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', '''59''', 1930, 168–90.</ref>約當的二次量子化方法運用在場的[[簡正模]]係數上，海森堡和鮑利則從場本身開始，並把正則方法直接應用到場上。因此，後二人所創立的，是現代量子場論導論中所用的基本理論框架。費米和狄拉克，以及{{le|弗拉基米爾·亞歷山大羅維奇·福克|Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock}}和[[鮑里斯·波多爾斯基]]，都分別用到不同的陳述，這都對日後的理論發展起到了啟發性的作用。

量子電動力學的根基有二。<ref>詳見{{harvtxt|Scharf|2014}}中短小精湛的''Historical introduction''一章</ref>其一為電磁場的量子化，即以光子為電磁場的激發態（或稱量子）。[[史蒂文·溫伯格]]指出：「光子是唯一一個被發現是粒子前就已經被認為是場的粒子」，所以量子電動力學很自然地以研究電磁場為始。<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|1995|p=15}}</ref>其二為電子的相對論性理論，其核心為狄拉克方程式。

===無限大的難題===
====無限大的產生====
[[File:Pascual Jordan 1920s.jpg|220px|thumb|left|[[帕斯庫爾·約當]]（1902至1980年），馬克斯·玻恩的學生，量子場論的開拓人之一，曾與玻恩和海森堡共同發表過多篇開創性論文。他發明的{{le|約當代數|Jordan algebra}}從數學形式上描述了量子力學中的[[可觀察量]]。1954年獲得[[馬克斯·普朗克獎章]]。]]

在最初的時候，量子場論是從量子力學方法類推而來的，雖然尚未是一個完整的獨立理論，但已經可以應用在某些實際相互作用過程中。這包括，輻射經自由電子的散射（[[康普頓散射]]）、電子之間相對論性速度的碰撞以及電子和[[正子]]從光子[[成對產生]]的過程。一階近似計算出的結果已經小有成果，但在這個領域中的大部分科學家仍然認為量子場論還需要一次重大的改變。在實驗方面，一些計算結果明顯和測量不符；在理論方面，所遇到的難題則更加嚴峻──[[微擾理論|微擾級數]]更高階項的計算結果為無限大。電子的{{le|自能|self-energy}}和電磁場的[[量子漲落|真空漲落]]都似乎是無限大。不但微擾級數沒有收斂，而且幾乎所有單獨的項都是發散的。

計算中出現林林總總的無限大，意味著問題不在於個別的計算。許多物理學家會用形式上的手段避開發散的難題，包括把動量積分截至某個動量值，甚至完全忽視無限大項。然而，這些手法都違反了相對論不變性的原則，所以並不可靠。一些物理學家發明了解決無限大的更可靠方法：重新定義理論中的參數（如電子電荷），以測量所得的有限數值替代原本無限大的值（所謂的「裸」值）。這個做法稱為[[重整化]]。

從1930年至第二次世界大戰這幾年當中，物理學界對量子場論態度各異。有的用較為隨意的方法繞過無限大的問題，有的則努力改進理論框架。大多數理論學家都相信量子電動力學會在高能量下崩潰。也有人主張量子場論以外的途徑，包括改變一些基本概念（如負概率和超距相互作用），以及在[[現象學]]上以分析可觀察量之間的關係為重點，而不是研究相互作用在細微的尺度上的種種細節。這種方法稱為{{le|S矩陣理論}}，它以各種散射過程的{{le|散射振幅|scattering amplitude|振幅}}為基本研究對象。

儘管量子場論不盡完美，又缺乏嚴謹，但其中的各種手法卻被應用到新的領域上。1933年，描述[[β衰變]]的{{le|費米理論|Fermi theory}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths |first=D.|authorlink=David J. Griffiths|year=2009|title=Introduction to Elementary Particles|edition=2nd |pages=314–15|isbn=978-3-527-40601-2}}</ref>把光子發射和吸收的解釋方法套用到β輻射上，對[[弱相互作用]]中電子和[[中微子]]的創生和消滅進行分析。量子場論又被成功應用在[[原子核物理學]]中的[[強相互作用]]上。1934年，鮑利和[[維克托·魏斯科普夫]]證明，由[[克莱恩-戈登方程式]]所描述的[[純量場]]同樣可以量子化，<ref>W. Pauli and V. Weisskopf, "Ueber<!--[sic]--> die Ouantizierung der skalaren relativistischen Wellengleichung," ''Helv. Phys. Acta'' '''7''', 1934.</ref>這是[[二次量子化]]的又一例子。這一描述物質場的新理論在十年以後被成功應用在新發現的[[π介子]]上。

====馴服無限大====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild183-R57262, Werner Heisenberg.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[維爾納·海森堡]]（1901至1976年），[[阿諾·索末菲]]的博士生，量子力學和量子場論的開創者之一。他發明了稱為[[矩陣力學]]的一種量子力學方法，著名的[[海森堡不確定性原理]]也是以他命名。1932年獲諾貝爾物理學獎。]]

第二次世界大戰結束後，理論學家在量子場論中無限大的問題上，找到了更可靠有效的解決方法。量子場論計算終於有了一致和系統化的規則，廣義的重整化理論也建立了起來。在1947年謝爾特島（{{lang-en|Shelter Island}}）、1948年波科諾（{{lang-en|Pocono}}）以及1949年奧爾德斯通（{{lang-en|Oldstone}}）三次舉足輕重的學術會議上，理論物理學家遇到了新的實驗結果。到了四十年代末，已出現了兩種解決無限大問題的方法：其一由[[理查德·費曼]]發明，另一基於算符形式的方法由[[朱利安·施溫格]]和[[朝永振一郎]]分別獨立發明。

1949年，[[弗里曼·戴森]]證明這兩種解決途徑是等價的，可以被納入同一個優雅的量子場論框架。就這樣，戴森、費曼、施溫格和朝永成為了重整化理論的奠基人。重整化理論最突出的成果包括計算電子的[[異常磁矩]]和[[氫]]原子光譜中的[[蘭姆位移]]，這些計算和高精度實驗之間的吻合程度在當時是空前的。然而，理論中有一些數學難題仍揮之不去，促使一些理論學家為此嘗試建立嚴謹的數學表述。

重整化的原理是把計算結果中的無限大轉移到理論中不影響對現實的預測的另一部分，以此避開這些無限大值。戴森證明，對電荷和質量進行縮放（重整化），就足以一致地去除量子電動力學微擾理論中各階的所有發散。如果一個量子場論的所有無限大值都可以通過把[[耦合常數]]和質量重新定義為有限值來去除，則該量子場論被稱為可重整化。對量子電動力學來說，這一方法的結論是，電子的電荷和質量只能以實驗測量所得，而無法從第一原則推導出來。

微擾理論只有在可重整量子場論中才有良好定義的預測，量子電動力學就正好屬於這一類理論。重整化的步驟有許多種，其中一種是將計算中的動量積分截至某個大但仍然有限的動量值{{math|Λ}}。如果理論是可重整的，那麼最終的物理量就不會依賴於{{math|Λ}}，因此可以取{{math|Λ → ∞}}極限。<ref>詳見{{harvtxt|Peskin|Schroeder|1995}}第二部分有關重整化的詳細敘述。</ref>

[[File:Richard_Feynman_Nobel.jpg|220px|thumb|left|[[理查德·費曼]]（1918至1988年）。他在1942年的博士論文中建立了普通量子力學的[[路徑積分表述]]，這一表述之後又被推廣至量子場論。以他命名的費曼圖利用直觀的圖形來計算各種相互作用過程的振幅。1965年獲諾貝爾物理學獎。]]
[[File:ElectronPositronAnnihilation.svg|220px|thumb|left|描述電子和正子互相殲滅，產生[[離殼]]光子，再衰變為新的電子正子對的[[費曼圖]]。時間從左至右前進，箭頭順著時間的直線代表正子，箭頭與時間方向相反的直線代表電子，波浪線代表光子。]]
費曼所發明的[[費曼圖]]可以用來很直觀地整理和計算微擾級數的各個項，這些圖可以視為相互作用過程中粒子路徑的示意圖。要經相對論性協變微擾理論計算某個散射過程的振幅及概率，可以從相應的費曼圖讀出每個頂點和線，根據一套「費曼規則」一一對應上數學表達式，然後計算最終組成起來的數學公式。這種方法建基於量子場論的[[泛函積分]]表述。<ref>{{harvtxt|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|loc=Chapter4}}</ref>

圖中指向外的線稱為「外線」，它們代表入射和出射粒子；兩端都在圖內部的線稱為「內線」，它們代表[[虛粒子]]的傳播。內線兩端的頂點代表粒子間的相互作用。圖中的每一條線和每一個頂點都有相應的數學表達式，組合起來以後就可得出圖所代表的過程的振幅表達式。

粒子在點和點之間傳播的概念建立在[[惠更斯－菲涅耳原理]]的基礎上。這個概念在建立量子場論時有啟發性的作用，而在實際計算當中也能給出正確的粒子[[傳播子]]，結果與更嚴謹的推導方法相符。<ref>{{harvnb|Greiner|Reinhardt|1996}}</ref>

啟發性意義固然重要，但在分析過理論原理後可以得出結論，費曼圖方法的成功並不意味著這些粒子路徑確確實實是存在的。有種種論據證明量子場論不能以粒子來詮釋，這些論據也同樣明確證明費曼圖並不真正代表存在粒子的路徑。費曼自己則對這類[[本體論 (哲學)|本體論]]命題並沒有太大的興趣。

===黃金時代：規範場論和標準模型===
[[File:CNYang.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[楊振寧]]（生於1922年），[[非阿貝爾規範場論]]的發明人之一，1957年獲諾貝爾物理學獎。]]
[[File:MurrayGellMannJI1.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[默里·蓋爾曼]]（生於1929年），量子場論群對稱概念的開拓者，1969年獲諾貝爾物理學獎。]]
1933年，[[恩里科·費米]]就已經把量子場論確立為弱相互作用[[β衰變]]中粒子創生、殲滅及嬗變的最佳解釋，<ref>Yang, C. N. (2012). "Fermi's β-decay Theory". ''Asia Pacific Physics Newsletter'' '''1''' (01), 27–30. [http://physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/EP/yang_ijmp_a27_1230005_12.pdf online copy]</ref>是為{{le|費米理論|Fermi's interaction}}。因此，其他粒子交換作用也有期望能夠用量子場論來解釋。1950年代初，物理學界已經將量子電動力學視為可靠的理論。然而，從寫下第一組方程式，到系統性地把量子場論應用到重要的現實問題上，用了二十年的時間。

這些量子場論都在很大程度上依賴各式各樣的[[對稱性 (物理學)|對稱性]]，從某個對稱性條件甚至可以幾乎完全地確定整個理論。這一概念最早是由[[默里·蓋爾曼]]所開創的。夸克模型[[八重道]]中的[[特殊幺正群]]可以完全判斷理論的形式。單單從理論的對稱性建立{{le|流代數|current algebra}}，而不糾結於具體的動力學情況，所能做出的預測就已不勝枚舉。

[[File:YoichiroNambu.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[南部陽一郎]]（1921至2015年），量子場論[[自發對稱破缺]]機制的發現人之一，2008年獲諾貝爾物理學獎。]]

在理論學家把對稱性視為基礎概念之後，非阿貝爾[[規範場論]]和[[自發對稱破缺]]取得了重大成果。非阿貝爾規範場論是在1954至1960年間由[[楊振寧]]和[[羅伯特·米爾斯]]共同建立起來的，因此也被稱為[[楊-米爾斯理論]]。<ref name=YM>{{cite journal |authorlink1=Chen-Ning Yang |first1=C.

在[[彼得·希格斯]]、[[弗朗索瓦·恩格勒]]、[[羅伯特·布繞特]]、[[馬丁紐斯·韋爾特曼]]和[[傑拉德·特·胡夫特]]概念突破的基礎上，[[謝爾登·格拉肖]]、[[史蒂文·溫伯格]]和[[阿卜杜勒·薩拉姆]]的團隊在1959至1967年間，以及[[弗朗克·韋爾切克]]、[[大衛·格羅斯]]和[[休·波利策]]的團隊在1973年，分別拼集起一個基於{{math|SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)}}規範群的可重整化量子場論，這就是基本粒子物理[[標準模型]]。<!--(see [[History of quantum field theory#Electroweak unification|Electroweak unification]])-->
[[File:Gerard_'t_Hooft.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[傑拉德·特·胡夫特]]（生於1946年）證明了規範場論是可重整化的，1999年獲諾貝爾物理學獎。]]

標準模型中，存在十二種自旋為1/2的費米子，其中六種稱為[[輕子]]：電子、[[μ子]]、[[τ子]]及三者所對應的[[中微子]]；另外六種稱為[[夸克]]。除此之外，有幾種自旋為1、傳遞不同[[基本相互作用]]的規範玻色子：光子傳遞電磁相互作用，兩個[[W玻色子]]和一個[[Z玻色子]]傳遞弱相互作用，[[膠子]]傳遞強相互作用。最後，還有一個自旋為零的[[希格斯玻色子]]，它的自發對稱破缺機制是標準模型的關鍵元素。整個標準模型與實驗數據有著極佳的吻合。在理論預測的40年後，標準模型粒子中的最後一員希格斯玻色子的存在也終於在2012年得到了實驗證實。

=== 重整化群 ===
{{Main|重整化群}}

在標準模型建立起來的同時，[[凝聚態物理學|凝聚物理學家]]在對[[相變]]的了解上取得了突破，在[[重整化群]]的基礎上，對一些物理系統有了新穎的見解。從[[厄恩斯特·斯蒂克爾堡]]和{{le|安德烈·彼得曼|André Petermann}}（1953年）<ref>Stueckelberg, E. C. G. and A. Petermann (1953).

P. Kadanoff (1966): "Scaling laws for Ising models near <math>T_c</math>", ''Physics'' '''2''', 263.</ref>以及[[肯尼斯·威爾森]]和[[米高·費希爾]]（1972年）<ref>Kenneth G. Wilson and Michael E. Fisher, "Critical Exponents in 3.99 Dimensions", ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''28''' (1972), 240.</ref>的發展，最終形成威爾森在1975年發表的量子場論新表述。<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = K. | title = The renormalization group: Critical phenomena and the Kondo problem | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.47.773 | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 47 | issue = 4 | pages = 773 | year = 1975 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1975RvMP...47..773W }}</ref>這種表述讓理論學家能夠研究[[有效場論]]如何隨尺度演變，並把所有量子場論（不論是否可重整化）完全分類（詳見[[#重整化|下文]]）。一個重要的結論是，幾乎所有可觀察量都可以說是「無關緊要」的──在大部分系統中，大尺度上的物理現象只依賴於屈指可數的幾個可觀察量。

卡達諾夫在同一時期（1969年）<ref>L. P. Kadanoff (1969): "Operator Algebra and the Determination of Critical Indices", ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''23''' (1430), 1969.</ref>為二維[[易辛模型]]發明了一套{{le|算符代數|operator algebra}}表述。易辛模型是[[統計力學]]中描述[[鐵磁性]]的常用模型。他的研究結果意味著量子場論能夠描述易辛模型的縮放極限（即把格點間距縮至無限小的極限）。用有限個生成算符，就可以表示易辛模型中的所有{{le|相關函數|correlation function}}。

==方法==
Most theories in standard particle physics are formulated as ''relativistic quantum field theories'', such as QED, QCD, and the [[Standard Model]]. QED, the quantum field-theoretic description of the electromagnetic field, approximately reproduces [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of electrodynamics in the low-energy limit, with [[Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian|small non-linear corrections to the Maxwell equations]] required due to [[virtual particle|virtual]] electron–positron pairs.

===Perturbative and non-perturbative approaches===
In the [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] approach to quantum field theory, the full field interaction terms are approximated as a perturbative expansion in the number of particles involved. Each term in the expansion can be thought of as forces between particles being mediated by other particles. In QED, the [[electromagnetic force]] between two [[electrons]] is caused by an exchange of [[photons]]. Similarly, [[intermediate vector boson]]s mediate the [[weak force]] and [[gluons]] mediate the [[strong force]] in QCD. The notion of a force-mediating particle comes from [[perturbation theory]], and does not make sense in the context of [[non-perturbative]] approaches to QFT, such as with [[bound states]].

===QFT and gravity===
There is currently no complete quantum theory of the remaining [[fundamental interaction|fundamental force]], [[gravity]].  Many of the [[quantum gravity|proposed theories]] to describe gravity as a QFT postulate the existence of a [[graviton]] particle that mediates the gravitational force. Presumably, the as yet unknown correct quantum field-theoretic treatment of the gravitational field will behave like Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]] in the low-energy limit. Quantum field theory of the fundamental forces itself has been postulated to be the low-energy [[effective field theory]] limit of a more fundamental theory such as [[superstring theory]].

==Definition==
[[Quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) has one [[electron]] field and one [[photon]] field; [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) has one field for each type of [[quark]]; and, in condensed matter, there is an atomic displacement field that gives rise to [[phonon]] particles. [[Edward Witten]] describes QFT as "by far" the most difficult theory in modern physics<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beautiful Minds, Vol. 20: Ed Witten|url=http://temi.repubblica.it/iniziative-beautifulminds/|publisher=[[la Repubblica]]|year=2010|accessdate=22 June 2012}} See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsYRCLYH954&t=2m22s here].</ref> – "so difficult that nobody fully believed it for 25 years."<ref>{{Cite news |last= Cole |first= K. C. |date= 18 October 1987 |title= A Theory of Everything |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/magazine/a-theory-of-everything.html?pagewanted=all |journal= [[The New York Times Magazine]] |accessdate= 15 September 2016 }}</ref>

===Dynamics===
{{See also|Relativistic dynamics}}
Ordinary quantum mechanical systems have a fixed number of particles, with each particle having a finite number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. In contrast, the excited states of a quantum field can represent any number of particles. This makes quantum field theories especially useful for describing systems where the particle count/number may change over time, a crucial feature of relativistic dynamics. A QFT is thus an organized infinite array of oscillators.

===States===
QFT interaction terms are similar in spirit to those between charges with electric and magnetic fields in [[Maxwell's equations]]. However, unlike the classical fields of Maxwell's theory, fields in QFT generally exist in [[quantum superposition]]s of states and are subject to  the laws of quantum mechanics.

Because the fields are continuous quantities over space, there exist excited states with arbitrarily large numbers of particles in them, providing QFT systems with effectively an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Infinite degrees of freedom can easily lead to [[divergent series|divergences]] of calculated quantities (e.g., the quantities become infinite).  Techniques such as [[renormalization]] of QFT parameters or discretization of [[spacetime]], as in [[lattice QCD]], are often used to avoid such infinities so as to yield physically plausible results.

===Fields and radiation===
The [[gravitational field]] and the [[electromagnetic field]] are the only two fundamental fields in nature that have infinite range and a corresponding classical low-energy limit, which greatly diminishes and hides their "particle-like" excitations. [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905, attributed "particle-like" and discrete exchanges of momenta and energy, characteristic of "field quanta", to the electromagnetic field. Originally, his principal motivation was to explain the [[thermodynamics]] of [[radiation]]. Although the [[photoelectric effect]] and [[Compton scattering]] strongly suggest the existence of the photon, it might alternatively be explained by a mere quantization of emission; more definitive evidence of the quantum nature of radiation is now taken up into modern [[quantum optics]] as in the [[Photon antibunching|antibunching]] effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Thorn|Neel|Donato|Bergreen|2004}}</ref>

== Principles ==

=== Classical and quantum fields ===
{{main|Classical field theory}}

A classical field is a function defined over some region of space and duration in time.<ref name="tong1">{{harvnb|Tong|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref> Two physical phenomena which are described by classical fields are [[Newtonian gravitation]], described by [[Newtonian gravitational field]] '''g'''('''x''', ''t''), and [[classical electromagnetism]], described by the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic fields]] '''E'''('''x''', ''t'') and '''B'''('''x''', ''t''). Because such fields can in principle take on distinct values at each point in space, they are said to have infinite [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]].<ref name="tong1" />

Classical field theory does not, however, account for the quantum-mechanical aspects of such physical phenomena. For instance, it is known from quantum mechanics that certain aspects of electromagnetism involve discrete particles&mdash;[[photons]]&mdash;rather than continuous fields. The business of ''quantum'' field theory is to write down a field that is, like a classical field, a function defined over space and time, but which also accommodates the observations of quantum mechanics. This is a ''quantum field''.

To write down such a [[Canonical quantization#Field operators|quantum field]], one promotes the infinity of classical oscillators representing the modes of the classical fields to [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s. They thus become operator-valued functions (actually, distributions).<ref>{{cite book

Field theory, by sharp contrast, treats ''x'' as a label, an index of the field rather than as an operator.<ref>{{harvnb|Srednicki|2007|pp=25&ndash;26}}</ref>)

There are two common ways of handling a quantum field: [[canonical quantization]] and  the [[path integral formalism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Zee|2010|p=61}}</ref> The latter of these is pursued in this article.

==== Lagrangian formalism ====
Quantum field theory relies on the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] formalism from [[classical field theory]]. This formalism is analogous to the Lagrangian formalism used in [[classical mechanics]] to solve for the motion of a particle under the influence of a field. In classical field theory, one writes down a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]], <math>\mathcal{L}</math>, involving a field, φ('''x''',''t''), and possibly its first derivatives (∂φ/∂''t'' and ∇φ), and then applies a field-theoretic form of the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]. Writing coordinates (''t'', '''x''')&nbsp;= (''x''<sup>0</sup>, ''x''<sup>1</sup>, ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ''x''<sup>3</sup>) = ''x''<sup>μ</sup>, this form of the Euler–Lagrange equation is<ref name="tong1" />
:<math>\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} \left[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial\varphi/\partial x^\mu)}\right] - \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\varphi} = 0,</math>
where a sum over μ is performed according to the rules of [[Einstein notation]].

By solving this equation, one arrives at the "equations of motion" of the field.<ref name="tong1" /> For example, if one begins with the Lagrangian density
:<math> \mathcal{L}(\varphi,\nabla\varphi) = -\rho(t,\mathbf{x})\,\varphi(t,\mathbf{x}) - \frac{1}{8\pi G}|\nabla\varphi|^2,</math>
and then applies the Euler–Lagrange equation, one obtains the equation of motion
:<math> 4\pi G \rho(t,\mathbf{x}) = \nabla^2 \varphi.</math>
This equation is [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], expressed in differential form in terms of the [[gravitational potential]] φ(''t'', '''x''') and the [[mass density]] ρ(''t'', '''x'''). Despite the nomenclature, the "field" under study is the gravitational potential, φ, rather than the gravitational field, '''g'''. Similarly, when classical field theory is used to study electromagnetism, the "field" of interest is the electromagnetic [[four-potential]] (''V''/''c'', '''A'''), rather than the electric and magnetic fields '''E''' and '''B'''.

Quantum field theory uses this same Lagrangian procedure to determine the equations of motion for quantum fields. These equations of motion are then supplemented by [[commutation relation]]s derived from the canonical quantization procedure described below, thereby incorporating quantum mechanical effects into the behavior of the field.

=== Single- and many-particle quantum mechanics ===
{{main|Quantum mechanics|First quantization}}
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, a particle (such as an electron or proton) is described by a [[complex number|complex]] [[wavefunction]], {{math|''ψ''(''x'', ''t'')}}, whose time-evolution is governed by the [[Schrödinger equation]]:
:<math>-\frac{{\hbar}^2}{2m}\frac{{\partial}^2}{\partial x^2}\psi(x,t) + V(x)\psi(x,t) = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(x,t).</math>
Here {{math|''m''}} is the particle's [[mass]] and {{math|''V''(''x'')}} is the applied [[potential]]. Physical information about the behavior of the particle is extracted from the wavefunction by constructing [[expected value]]s for various quantities; for example, the expected value of the particle's position is given by integrating {{math|''ψ''<sup>*</sup>(''x'') ''x'' ''ψ''(''x'')}} over all space, and the expected value of the particle's [[momentum]] is found by integrating {{math|&minus;''iħ''ψ<sup>*</sup>(''x'')d''ψ''/d''x''}}. The quantity {{math|''ψ''<sup>*</sup>(''x'')''ψ''(''x'')}} is itself in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics interpreted as a [[probability density function]]. This treatment of quantum mechanics, where a particle's wavefunction evolves against a classical background potential {{math|''V''(''x'')}}, is sometimes called ''first quantization''.

This description of quantum mechanics can be extended to describe the behavior of multiple particles, so long as the number and the type of particles remain fixed. The particles are described by a wavefunction {{math|''ψ''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, ''x<sub>N</sub>'', ''t'')}}, which is governed by an extended version of the Schrödinger equation.

Often one is interested in the case where {{math|''N''}} particles are all of the same type (for example, the 18 electrons orbiting a neutral [[argon]] nucleus). As described in the article on [[identical particles]], this implies that the state of the entire system must be either symmetric ([[boson]]s) or antisymmetric ([[fermion]]s) when the coordinates of its constituent particles are exchanged. This is achieved by using a [[Slater determinant]] as the wavefunction of a fermionic system (and a Slater [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] for a bosonic system), which is equivalent to an element of the symmetric or antisymmetric subspace of a tensor product.

For example, the general quantum state of a system of {{math|''N''}} bosons is written as

:<math> |\phi_1 \cdots \phi_N \rang = \sqrt{\frac{\prod_j N_j!}{N!}} \sum_{p\in S_N} |\phi_{p(1)}\rang \otimes \cdots \otimes |\phi_{p(N)} \rang,</math>

where <math>|\phi_i\rang</math> are the single-particle states, {{math|''N<sub>j</sub>''}} is the number of particles occupying state {{math|''j''}}, and the sum is taken over all possible [[permutation]]s {{math|''p''}} acting on {{math|''N''}} elements. In general, this is a sum of {{math|''N''!}} ({{math|''N''}} [[factorial]]) distinct terms. <math>\sqrt{\frac{\prod_j N_j!}{N!}}</math> is a normalizing factor.

There are several shortcomings to the above description of quantum mechanics, which are addressed by quantum field theory. First, it is unclear how to extend quantum mechanics to include the effects of [[special relativity]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tong|2015|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Attempted replacements for the Schrödinger equation, such as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] or the [[Dirac equation]], have many unsatisfactory qualities; for instance, they possess energy [[eigenvalues]] that extend to &ndash;∞, so that there seems to be no easy definition of a [[ground state]]. It turns out that such inconsistencies arise from relativistic wavefunctions not having a well-defined probabilistic interpretation in position space, as probability conservation is not a [[Lorentz covariance|relativistically covariant]] concept. The second shortcoming, related to the first, is that in quantum mechanics there is no mechanism to describe particle creation and annihilation;<ref>{{harvnb|Zee|2010|p=3}}</ref> this is crucial for describing phenomena such as [[pair production]], which result from the conversion between mass and energy according to the relativistic relation [[Mass–energy equivalence|''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>]].

=== Second quantization ===
{{Main|Second quantization}}

In this section, we will describe a method for constructing a quantum field theory called '''[[second quantization]]'''. This basically involves choosing a way to index the quantum mechanical degrees of freedom in the space of multiple identical-particle states. It is based on the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] formulation of quantum mechanics.

Several other approaches exist, such as the [[Feynman path integral]],<ref>{{harvnb|Pais|1994}}. Pais recounts how his astonishment at the rapidity with which [[Feynman]] could calculate using his method. Feynman's method is now part of the standard methods for physicists.</ref> which uses a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] formulation. For an overview of some of these approaches, see the article on [[quantization (physics)|quantization]].

==== Bosons ====
For simplicity, we will first discuss second quantization for [[boson]]s, which form perfectly symmetric quantum states. Let us denote the mutually orthogonal single-particle states which are possible in the system by <math>|\phi_1\rang, |\phi_2\rang, |\phi_3\rang,</math> and so on. For example, the 3-particle state with one particle in state <math>|\phi_1\rang</math> and two in state <math>|\phi_2\rang</math> is

:<math> \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left[ |\phi_1\rang |\phi_2\rang
|\phi_2\rang + |\phi_2\rang |\phi_1\rang |\phi_2\rang + |\phi_2\rang
|\phi_2\rang |\phi_1\rang \right]. </math>

The first step in second quantization is to express such quantum states in terms of '''occupation numbers''', by listing the number of particles occupying each of the single-particle states <math>|\phi_1\rang, |\phi_2\rang, </math> etc. This is simply another way of labelling the states. For instance, the above 3-particle state is denoted as

:<math> |1, 2, 0, 0, 0, \dots \rangle.</math>

An ''N''-particle state belongs to a space of states describing systems of ''N'' particles. The next step is to combine the individual ''N''-particle state spaces into an extended state space, known as [[Fock space]], which can describe systems of any number of particles. This is composed of the state space of a system with no particles (the so-called [[vacuum state]], written as <math>|0\rang</math>), plus the state space of a 1-particle system, plus the state space of a 2-particle system, and so forth. States describing a definite number of particles are known as [[Fock state]]s: a general element of Fock space will be a linear combination of Fock states. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the occupation number representation and valid boson states in the Fock space.

At this point, the quantum mechanical system has become a quantum field in the sense we described above. The field's elementary degrees of freedom are the occupation numbers, and each occupation number is indexed by a number <math>j</math> indicating which of the single-particle states <math>|\phi_1\rang, |\phi_2\rang,\dots,|\phi_j\rang,\dots</math> it refers to:
:<math> | N_1, N_2, N_3, \dots, N_j, \dots \rang .</math>

The properties of this quantum field can be explored by defining [[creation and annihilation operators]], which add and subtract particles. They are analogous to [[ladder operators]] in the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] problem, which added and subtracted energy quanta. However, these operators literally create and annihilate particles of a given quantum state. The bosonic annihilation operator <math>a_2</math> and creation operator <math>a_2^\dagger</math> are easily defined in the occupation number representation as having the following effects:

:<math> a_2 | N_1, N_2, N_3, \dots \rang = \sqrt{N_2} \mid N_1, (N_2 - 1), N_3, \dots \rang,</math>
:<math> a_2^\dagger | N_1, N_2, N_3, \dots \rang = \sqrt{N_2 + 1} \mid N_1, (N_2 + 1), N_3, \dots \rang.</math>

It can be shown that these are operators in the usual quantum mechanical sense, i.e. [[linear operator]]s acting on the Fock space. Furthermore, they are indeed [[Hermitian adjoint|Hermitian conjugates]], which justifies the way we have written them. They can be shown to obey the [[commutator|commutation relation]]

:<math>
\left[a_i , a_j \right] = 0 \quad,\quad
\left[a_i^\dagger , a_j^\dagger \right] = 0 \quad,\quad
\left[a_i , a_j^\dagger \right] = \delta_{ij},
</math>

where <math>\delta</math> stands for the [[Kronecker delta]]. These are precisely the relations obeyed by the ladder operators for an infinite set of independent [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s, one for each single-particle state. Adding or removing bosons from each state is, therefore, analogous to exciting or de-exciting a quantum of energy in a harmonic oscillator.

Applying an annihilation operator <math>a_k</math> followed by its corresponding creation operator <math>a_k^\dagger</math> returns the number <math>N_k</math> of particles in the ''k''<sup>th</sup> single-particle eigenstate:
:<math>a_k^\dagger\,a_k|\dots, N_k, \dots \rangle=N_k| \dots, N_k, \dots \rangle.</math>
The combination of operators <math>a_k^\dagger a_k</math> is known as the [[number operator]] for the ''k''<sup>th</sup> eigenstate.

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]] of the quantum field (which, through the [[Schrödinger equation]], determines its dynamics) can be written in terms of creation and annihilation operators. For instance, for a field of free (non-interacting) bosons, the total energy of the field is found by summing the energies of the bosons in each energy eigenstate. If the ''k''<sup>th</sup> single-particle energy eigenstate has energy <math>E_k</math> and there are <math>N_k</math> bosons in this state, then the total energy of these bosons is <math>E_k N_k</math>. The energy in the ''entire'' field is then a sum over <math>k</math>:
:<math> E_\mathrm{tot} = \sum_k E_k N_k</math>
This can be turned into the Hamiltonian operator of the field by replacing <math>N_k</math> with the corresponding number operator, <math>a_k^\dagger a_k</math>. This yields
:<math>H = \sum_k E_k \, a^\dagger_k \,a_k.</math>

==== Fermions ====
It turns out that a different definition of creation and annihilation must be used for describing [[fermion]]s. According to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], fermions cannot share quantum states, so their occupation numbers ''N<sub>i</sub>'' can only take on the value 0 or 1. The fermionic annihilation operators ''c'' and creation operators <math>c^\dagger</math> are defined by their actions on a Fock state thus

:<math> c_j | N_1, N_2, \dots, N_j = 0, \dots \rangle = 0 </math>
:<math> c_j | N_1, N_2, \dots, N_j = 1, \dots \rangle = (-1)^{(N_1 + \cdots + N_{j-1})} | N_1, N_2, \dots, N_j = 0, \dots \rangle </math>
:<math> c_j^\dagger | N_1, N_2, \dots, N_j = 0, \dots \rangle = (-1)^{(N_1 + \cdots + N_{j-1})} | N_1, N_2, \dots, N_j = 1, \dots \rangle </math>
:<math> c_j^\dagger | N_1, N_2, \dots, N_j = 1, \dots \rangle = 0. </math>

These obey an [[anticommutator|anticommutation relation]]:

:<math>
\left\{c_i , c_j \right\} = 0 \quad,\quad
\left\{c_i^\dagger , c_j^\dagger \right\} = 0 \quad,\quad
\left\{c_i , c_j^\dagger \right\} = \delta_{ij}.
</math>

One may notice from this that applying a fermionic creation operator twice gives zero, so it is impossible for the particles to share single-particle states, in accordance with the exclusion principle.

==== Field operators ====
{{see also|Canonical quantization}}
We have previously mentioned that there can be more than one way of indexing the degrees of freedom in a quantum field. Second quantization indexes the field by enumerating the single-particle quantum states. However, as we have discussed, it is more natural to think about a "field", such as the electromagnetic field, as a set of degrees of freedom indexed by position.

To this end, we can define ''field operators'' that create or destroy a particle at a particular point in space. In particle physics, these operators turn out to be more convenient to work with, because they make it easier to formulate theories that satisfy the demands of relativity.

Single-particle states are usually enumerated in terms of their [[momentum|momenta]] (as in the [[particle in a box]] problem.) We can construct field operators by applying the [[Fourier transform]] to the creation and annihilation operators for these states. For example, the bosonic field annihilation operator <math>\phi(\mathbf{r})</math> is

:<math>\phi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \sum_{j} e^{i\mathbf{k}_j\cdot \mathbf{r}} a_{j}. </math>

The bosonic field operators obey the commutation relation

:<math>
\left[\phi(\mathbf{r}) , \phi(\mathbf{r'}) \right] = 0 \quad,\quad
\left[\phi^\dagger(\mathbf{r}) , \phi^\dagger(\mathbf{r'}) \right] = 0 \quad,\quad
\left[\phi(\mathbf{r}) , \phi^\dagger(\mathbf{r'}) \right] = \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'})
</math>

where <math>\delta(x)</math> stands for the [[Dirac delta function]]. As before, the fermionic relations are the same, with the commutators replaced by anticommutators.

The field operator is not the same thing as a single-particle wavefunction. The former is an operator acting on the Fock space, and the latter is a quantum-mechanical amplitude for finding a particle in some position. However, they are closely related and are indeed commonly denoted with the same symbol. If we have a Hamiltonian with a space representation, say

:<math>H = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \sum_i \nabla_i^2 + \sum_{i < j} U(|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|) </math>

where the indices ''i'' and ''j'' run over all particles, then the field theory Hamiltonian (in the non-relativistic limit and for negligible self-interactions) is

:<math>H = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \int d^3\!r \ \phi^\dagger(\mathbf{r}) \nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{1}{2}\int\!d^3\!r \int\!d^3\!r' \; \phi^\dagger(\mathbf{r}) \phi^\dagger(\mathbf{r}') U(|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|) \phi(\mathbf{r'}) \phi(\mathbf{r}). </math>

This looks remarkably like an expression for the expectation value of the energy, with <math>\phi</math> playing the role of the wavefunction. This relationship between the field operators and wave functions makes it very easy to formulate field theories starting from space projected Hamiltonians.

=== Dynamics ===
Once the Hamiltonian operator is obtained as part of the [[canonical quantization]] process, the time dependence of the state is described with the [[Schrödinger equation]], just as with other quantum theories. 
Alternatively, the [[Heisenberg picture]] can be used where the time dependence is in the operators rather than in the states.

Probability amplitudes of observables in such systems are quite hard to evaluate, an enterprise which has absorbed considerable ingenuity in the last three quarters of a century. In practice, most often, expectation values of operators are computed systematically through ''covariant perturbation theory'', formulated through [[Feynman diagram]]s, but [[path integral formulation|path integral]] computer simulations have also produced important results. Contemporary  [[particle physics]] relies on extraordinarily accurate predictions of such techniques.

=== Implications ===

==== Unification of fields and particles ====
The "second quantization" procedure  outlined in the previous section takes a set of single-particle quantum states as a starting point. Sometimes, it is impossible to define such single-particle states, and one must proceed directly to quantum field theory. For example, a quantum theory of the [[electromagnetic field]] ''must'' be a quantum field theory, because it is impossible (for various reasons) to define a [[wavefunction]] for a single [[photon]].<ref>
{{harvnb|Newton|Wigner|1949|pp=400–06}}</ref> In such situations, the quantum field theory can be constructed by examining the mechanical properties of the classical field and guessing the [[correspondence principle|corresponding]] quantum theory. For free (non-interacting) quantum fields, the quantum field theories obtained in this way have the same properties as those obtained using second quantization, such as well-defined creation and annihilation operators obeying commutation or anticommutation relations.

Quantum field theory thus provides a unified framework for describing "field-like" objects (such as the electromagnetic field, whose excitations are photons) and "particle-like" objects (such as electrons, which are treated as excitations of an underlying electron field), so long as one can treat interactions as "perturbations" of free fields.

==== Physical meaning of particle indistinguishability ====
The second quantization procedure relies crucially on the particles being [[identical particles|identical]]. We would not have been able to construct a quantum field theory from a distinguishable many-particle system, because there would have been no way of separating and indexing the degrees of freedom.

Many physicists prefer to take the converse interpretation, which is that ''quantum field theory explains what identical particles are''. In ordinary quantum mechanics, there is not much theoretical motivation for using symmetric (bosonic) or antisymmetric (fermionic) states, and the need for such states is simply regarded as an empirical fact. From the point of view of quantum field theory, particles are identical [[if and only if]] they are excitations of the same underlying quantum field. Thus, the question "why are all electrons identical?" arises from mistakenly regarding individual electrons as fundamental objects, when in fact it is only the electron field that is fundamental.

==== Particle conservation and non-conservation ====
During second quantization, we started with a Hamiltonian and state space describing a fixed [[Particle number|number of particles]] (''N''), and ended with a Hamiltonian and state space for an arbitrary number of particles. Of course, in many common situations ''N'' is an important and perfectly well-defined quantity, e.g. if we are describing a gas of [[particle in a box|atoms sealed in a box]]. From the point of view of quantum field theory, such situations are described by quantum states that are eigenstates of the [[particle number operator|number operator]] <math>\hat{N}</math>, which measures the total number of particles present. As with any quantum mechanical observable, <math>\hat{N}</math> is conserved if it commutes with the Hamiltonian. In that case, the quantum state is trapped in the ''N''-particle [[Euclidean subspace|subspace]] of the total Fock space, and the situation could equally well be described by ordinary ''N''-particle quantum mechanics. (Strictly speaking, this is only true in the noninteracting case or in the low energy density limit of renormalized quantum field theories.)

For example, we can see that the free boson Hamiltonian described above conserves particle number. Whenever the Hamiltonian operates on a state, each particle destroyed by an annihilation operator <math>a_k</math> is immediately put back by the creation operator <math>a_k^\dagger</math>.

On the other hand, it is possible, and indeed common, to encounter quantum states that are ''not'' eigenstates of <math>\hat{N}</math>, which do not have well-defined particle numbers. Such states are difficult or impossible to handle using ordinary quantum mechanics, but they can be easily described in quantum field theory as [[quantum superposition]]s of states having different values of ''N''. For example, suppose we have a bosonic field whose particles can be created or destroyed by interactions with a fermionic field. The Hamiltonian of the combined system would be given by the Hamiltonians of the free boson and free fermion fields, plus a "potential energy" term such as

:<math>H_I = \sum_{k,q} V_q (a_q + a_{-q}^\dagger) c_{k+q}^\dagger c_k</math>

where <math>a_k^\dagger</math> and <math>a_k</math> denotes the bosonic creation and annihilation operators, <math>c_k^\dagger</math> and <math>c_k</math> denotes the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, and <math>V_q</math> is a parameter that describes the strength of the interaction. This "interaction term" describes processes in which a fermion in state ''k'' either absorbs or emits a boson, thereby being kicked into a different eigenstate <math>k+q</math>. (In fact, this type of Hamiltonian is used to describe the interaction between [[conduction electron]]s and [[phonon]]s in [[metal]]s. The interaction between electrons and [[photon]]s is treated in a similar way, but is a little more complicated because the role of [[spin (physics)|spin]] must be taken into account.) One thing to notice here is that even if we start out with a fixed number of bosons, we will typically end up with a superposition of states with different numbers of bosons at later times. The number of fermions, however, is conserved in this case.

In [[condensed matter physics]], states with ill-defined particle numbers are particularly important for describing the various [[superfluid]]s. Many of the defining characteristics of a superfluid arise from the notion that its quantum state is a superposition of states with different particle numbers. In addition, the concept of a coherent state (used to model the laser and the BCS ground state) refers to a state with an ill-defined particle number but a well-defined phase.

== Associated phenomena ==
Beyond  the most general features of quantum field theories,  special aspects  such as renormalizability, gauge symmetry, and supersymmetry are outlined below.

=== Renormalization ===
{{Main|Renormalization}}
Early in the history of quantum field theory, as detailed above, it was found that many seemingly innocuous calculations, such as the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] shift in the energy of an electron due to the presence of the electromagnetic field, yield infinite results. The reason is that the perturbation theory for the shift in an energy involves a sum over ''all other energy levels, and there are infinitely many levels'' at short distances, so that each gives a finite contribution which results in a divergent series.

Many of these problems are related to failures in [[classical electrodynamics]] that were identified but unsolved in the 19th century, and they basically stem from the fact that many of the supposedly "intrinsic" properties of an electron are tied to the electromagnetic field that it carries around with it. The energy carried by a single electron&mdash;its [[self-energy]]&mdash;is not simply the bare value, but also includes the energy contained in its electromagnetic field, its attendant cloud of photons. The energy in a field of a spherical source diverges in both classical and quantum mechanics, but as discovered by [[Victor Weisskopf|Weisskopf]] with help from [[Wendell Furry|Furry]], in quantum mechanics ''the divergence is much milder'', going ''only as the logarithm'' of the radius of the sphere.

The solution to the problem, presciently suggested by [[Ernst Stueckelberg|Stueckelberg]], independently by [[Hans Bethe|Bethe]] after the crucial experiment by [[Willis Lamb|Lamb]] and [[Robert Retherford|Retherford]] (the [[Lamb–Retherford experiment]]), implemented at one loop by [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], and systematically extended to all loops by [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] and [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson]], with converging work by [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga|Tomonaga]] in isolated postwar Japan, comes from recognizing that all the infinities in the interactions of photons and electrons can be isolated into redefining a finite number of quantities in the equations by replacing them with the observed values: specifically the electron's mass and charge: this is called [[renormalization]]. The technique of renormalization recognizes that the problem is tractable and essentially purely mathematical; and that, physically, extremely short distances are at fault.

In order to define a theory on a continuum, one may first place a [[cutoff (physics)|cutoff]] on the fields, by postulating that quanta cannot have energies above some extremely high value. This has the effect of replacing continuous space by a structure where very short wavelengths do not exist, as on a lattice. Lattices break rotational symmetry, and one of the crucial contributions made by Feynman, Pauli and Villars, and modernized by [[Gerardus 't Hooft|'t Hooft]] and [[Martinus Veltman|Veltman]], is a symmetry-preserving cutoff  for perturbation theory (this process is called [[regularization (physics)|regularization]]). There is no known symmetrical cutoff outside of perturbation theory, so for rigorous or numerical work people often use an actual [[lattice gauge theory|lattice]].

On a lattice, every quantity is finite but depends on the spacing. When taking the limit to zero spacing, one makes sure that the physically observable quantities like the observed electron mass stay fixed, which means that the constants in the Lagrangian defining the theory depend on the spacing. By allowing the constants to vary with the lattice spacing, all the results at long distances become insensitive to the lattice, defining a [[scaling limit|continuum limit]].

The renormalization procedure only works for a certain limited class of quantum field theories, called ''renormalizable quantum field theories''. A theory is ''perturbatively renormalizable'' when the constants in the Lagrangian only diverge at worst as ''logarithms'' of the lattice spacing for very short spacings. The continuum limit is then well defined in perturbation theory, and even if it is not fully well defined non-perturbatively, the problems only show up at distance scales that are exponentially small in the inverse coupling for weak couplings. The [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] is perturbatively renormalizable, and so are its component theories ([[quantum electrodynamics]]/[[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]]). Of the three components, quantum electrodynamics is believed to not have a continuum limit by itself, while the [[asymptotic freedom|asymptotically free]] ''SU(2)'' and ''SU(3)'' weak  and strong color interactions are nonperturbatively well defined.

The [[renormalization group]] as developed along [[Kenneth Geddes Wilson|Wilson's]] breakthrough insights relates [[effective field theories]] at a given scale to such at contiguous scales. It thus describes how renormalizable theories emerge as the long distance low-energy [[effective field theory]] for any given high-energy theory. As a consequence, renormalizable theories are insensitive to the precise nature of the underlying high-energy short-distance phenomena (the macroscopic physics is dominated by only a few ''"relevant" observables''). This is a blessing in practical terms, because it allows physicists to formulate low energy theories without detailed knowledge of high-energy phenomena. It is also a curse, because once a renormalizable theory such as  the standard model is found to work, it provides very few clues to higher-energy processes.

The only way high-energy processes can be seen in the standard model is when they allow otherwise forbidden events, or else if they reveal predicted compelling quantitative relations among the coupling constants of the theories or models.

On account of renormalization, the couplings of QFT vary with scale, thereby confining quarks into hadrons, allowing the study of weakly-coupled quarks inside hadrons, and enabling speculation on ultra-high energy behavior.

=== Gauge freedom ===
A [[gauge theory]] is a theory that admits a [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] with a local parameter. For example, in every [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] theory, the global [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the [[wave function]] is arbitrary and does not represent something physical. Consequently, the theory is invariant under a global change of phases (adding a constant to the phase of all wave functions, everywhere); this is a [[global symmetry]]. In [[quantum electrodynamics]], the theory is also invariant under a ''local'' change of phase, that is – one may shift the phase of all [[wave function]]s so that the shift may be different at every point in space-time. This is a ''local'' symmetry. However, in order for a well-defined [[derivative]] operator to exist, one must introduce a new [[field (physics)|field]], the [[gauge field]], which also transforms in order for the local change of variables (the phase in our example) not to affect the derivative. In quantum electrodynamics, this gauge field is the [[electromagnetic field]]. The change of local gauge of variables is termed [[gauge transformation]].

By [[Noether's theorem]], for every such symmetry there exists an associated [[conserved current]]. The aforementioned symmetry of the wavefunction under global phase changes implies the [[Charge conservation|conservation of electric charge]]. Since  the excitations of fields represent [[Elementary particle|particles]], the particle associated with excitations of the [[gauge field]] is the [[gauge boson]], e.g., the [[photon]] in the case of quantum electrodynamics.

The [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in quantum field theory are local fluctuations of the fields. The existence of a gauge symmetry reduces the number of degrees of freedom, simply because some fluctuations of the fields can be transformed to zero by gauge transformations, so they are equivalent to having no fluctuations at all, and they, therefore, have no physical meaning. Such fluctuations are usually called "non-physical degrees of freedom" or ''gauge artifacts''; usually, some of them have a negative [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], making them inadequate for a consistent theory. Therefore, if a classical field theory has a gauge symmetry, then its quantized version (the corresponding quantum field theory) will have this symmetry as well. In other words, a gauge symmetry cannot have a quantum [[Anomaly (physics)|anomaly]].<ref>
If a gauge symmetry is [[Gauge anomaly|anomalous]] (i.e. not kept in the quantum theory) then the theory is inconsistent: for example, in quantum electrodynamics, had there been a [[gauge anomaly]], this would require the appearance of [[photon]]s with [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[photon polarization|polarization]] and polarization in the time direction, the latter having a negative [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], rendering the theory inconsistent; another possibility would be for these photons to appear only in intermediate processes but not in the final products of any interaction, making the theory non-[[unitarity|unitary]] and again inconsistent (see [[optical theorem]]).</ref>

In general, the gauge transformations of a theory consist of several different transformations, which may not be [[commutative]]. These transformations are combine into the framework of a [[gauge group]]; [[infinitesimal]] [[gauge transformation]]s are the [[gauge group]] [[generator (mathematics)|generator]]s. Thus, the number of gauge bosons is the group [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]] (i.e., the number of generators forming the  [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the corresponding Lie algebra).

All the known [[fundamental interaction]]s in nature are described by gauge theories (possibly barring the Higgs multiplet couplings, if considered in isolation). These are:
* [[Quantum chromodynamics]], whose [[gauge group]] is [[SU(3)|''SU''(3)]]. The [[gauge boson]]s are eight [[gluon]]s.
* The [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]], whose [[gauge group]] is ''U''(1) &times; ''SU''(2), (a [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of ''U''(1) and [[SU(2)|''SU''(2)]]). The gauge bosons are the photon and the massive ''W<sup>±</sup>'' and ''Z⁰'' bosons.
* [[Gravity]], whose classical theory is [[general relativity]],  relies on the [[equivalence principle]], which is essentially a form of gauge symmetry. Its action may also be written as a gauge theory of the [[Lorentz group]] on [[Spin connection|tangent space]].<ref>However, it is  non-renormalizable. Veltman, M. J. G. (1976). "Methods in Field Theory, Proceedings of the Les Houches Summer School, Les Houches, France, 1975".</ref>

=== Supersymmetry ===
{{Main|Supersymmetry}}

[[Supersymmetry]] assumes that every fundamental [[fermion]] has a superpartner that is a [[boson]] and vice versa. Its gauge theory, [[Supergravity]], is an extension of general relativity. Supersymmetry is a key ingredient for the consistency of [[string theory]].

It was utilized  in order to solve the so-called [[Hierarchy problem|Hierarchy Problem]] of the standard model, that is, to explain why particles not protected by any symmetry (like the [[Higgs boson]]) do not receive radiative corrections to their mass, driving it to the larger scales such as that of GUTs, or the Planck mass of gravity. The way supersymmetry protects  scale hierarchies is the following: since for every particle there is a superpartner with the same mass but different statistics,  any loop in a radiative correction is cancelled by the loop corresponding to its superpartner, rendering the theory more UV finite.

Since, however,  no super partners have been observed, if supersymmetry existed it should be  broken severely (through a so-called soft term, which breaks supersymmetry without ruining its helpful features). The simplest models of this breaking require that the energy of the superpartners not be too high; in these cases, supersymmetry could be observed by experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. However, to date, after the observation of the Higgs boson there, no such superparticles have been discovered.

== Axiomatic approaches ==
The preceding description of quantum field theory follows the spirit in which most [[physicist]]s approach the subject. However, it is not [[rigour|mathematically rigorous]]. Over the past several decades, there have been many attempts to put quantum field theory on a firm mathematical footing by formulating a set of [[axiom]]s for it. Finding proper axioms for quantum field theory is still an open and difficult problem in mathematics.  One of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]]&mdash;proving the existence of a [[Yang–Mills existence and mass gap|mass gap in Yang–Mills theory]]&mdash;is linked to this issue. These attempts fall into two broad classes.

===Wightman axioms===
{{main article|Wightman axioms}}
The first class of axioms, first proposed during the 1950s, include the [[Wightman axioms|Wightman]], [[Osterwalder–Schrader theorem|Osterwalder–Schrader]], and [[Haag–Kastler]] systems. They attempted to formalize the physicists' notion of an "operator-valued field" within the context of [[functional analysis]] and enjoyed limited success.  It was possible to prove that any quantum field theory satisfying these axioms satisfied certain general theorems, such as the [[spin-statistics theorem]] and the [[CPT symmetry|CPT theorem]].  Unfortunately, it proved extraordinarily difficult to show that any realistic field theory, including the [[Standard Model]], satisfied these axioms.  Most of the theories that could be treated with these analytic axioms were physically trivial, being restricted to low-dimensions and lacking interesting dynamics. The construction of theories satisfying one of these sets of axioms falls in the field of [[constructive quantum field theory]]. Important work was done in this area in the 1970s by Segal, Glimm, Jaffe and others.

===Topological quantum field theory===
{{main article|Topological quantum field theory}}
During the 1980s, the second set of axioms based on [[topological]] ideas was proposed. Before 1980 all states of matter could be classified by [[geometry]] and the principle of [[broken symmetry]]. For example [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[general relativity]] is based on the geometrical curvature of space and time, while crystals, magnets and superconductors can all be classified by the symmetries they break. In 1980 the [[quantum Hall effect]] provided the first example of a state of matter that has no spontaneous broken symmetry; its characterization is dependant on its [[topology]] and not on its [[geometry]] (See [[Geometry and topology|geometry v. topology]]). The quantum Hall effect can be described by extending quantum field theory into an [[Effective field theory|effective]] [[topological quantum field theory]] based on the [[Chern–Simons theory]].<ref name = "Qi 2010"/> This line of investigation, which extends quantum field theories to [[topological quantum field theory|topological quantum field theories]], is associated most closely with [[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Graeme Segal]], and was notably expanded upon by [[Edward Witten]], [[Richard Borcherds]], and [[Maxim Kontsevich]]. The main impact of topological quantum field theory has been in [[condensed matter physics]] where physicists have observed exotic quasiparticles such as [[magnetic monopoles]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=M.

=== Haag's theorem ===
{{main|Haag's theorem}}
From a mathematically rigorous perspective, there exists no [[interaction picture]] in a Lorentz-covariant quantum field theory. This implies that the perturbative approach of [[Feynman diagram]]s in  QFT is not strictly justified, despite producing vastly precise predictions validated by experiment. This is called  [[Haag's theorem]], but most particle physicists relying on QFT largely shrug it off, as it is not really limiting the power of the theory.
